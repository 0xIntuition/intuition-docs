# Trust & Reputation Systems

Leverage Intuition's ability to create verifiable reputation systems that work across platforms and applications.

## Cross-Platform Identity Verification

Build a decentralized identity system where users can prove credentials across multiple platforms using Intuition's attestation system.

### **What You'll Build**

An identity verification platform where users can create and verify credentials (education, employment, skills) that work across any application or platform.

### **Key Features**

- **Credential Verification**: Institutions can attest to user credentials
- **Cross-Platform Portability**: Credentials work across all applications
- **Privacy Control**: Users control what information to share
- **Economic Incentives**: Rewards for verified credentials

### **Implementation**

```typescript
// Example structure for cross-platform identity system
import { createAtomFromString, createTripleStatement, getEthMultiVaultAddress } from '@0xintuition/sdk'

// Get the correct vault address for the current chain
const ethMultiVaultAddress = getEthMultiVaultAddress(walletClient.chain.id)

// Create user identity atom - represents the person being verified
// This creates a unique identifier for the user's identity with their DID
const userIdentityAtom = await createAtomFromString(
  { walletClient, publicClient, address: ethMultiVaultAddress },
  'user:alice_johnson - did:ethr:0x123...'
)

// Create university atom - represents the verifying institution
// This identifies the university that is issuing the credential
const universityAtom = await createAtomFromString(
  { walletClient, publicClient, address: ethMultiVaultAddress },
  'institution:stanford_university'
)

// Create degree atom - represents the specific credential being issued
// This creates a unique identifier for the bachelor's degree in computer science
const degreeAtom = await createAtomFromString(
  { walletClient, publicClient, address: ethMultiVaultAddress },
  'credential:bachelor_degree_computer_science'
)

// University attestation to degree - links the university to the credential they issue
// This creates a semantic statement: "stanford_university ATTESTS_TO bachelor_degree_computer_science"
const degreeAttestationTriple = await createTripleStatement(
  { walletClient, publicClient, address: ethMultiVaultAddress },
  {
    args: [universityAtom.state.vaultId, 'ATTESTS_TO', degreeAtom.state.vaultId]
  }
)

// Link user to degree - connects the user to their earned credential
// This creates a semantic statement: "user:alice_johnson HAS_CREDENTIAL bachelor_degree_computer_science"
const userDegreeTriple = await createTripleStatement(
  { walletClient, publicClient, address: ethMultiVaultAddress },
  {
    args: [userIdentityAtom.state.vaultId, 'HAS_CREDENTIAL', degreeAtom.state.vaultId]
  }
)
```

## Decentralized Credit Scoring

Create a credit scoring system based on community attestations and economic behavior rather than traditional credit bureaus.

### **What You'll Build**

A decentralized credit scoring platform where users' financial behavior and community trust determine their creditworthiness, with privacy-preserving verification.

### **Key Features**

- **Behavior-Based Scoring**: Credit score based on economic behavior
- **Community Trust**: Reputation from community attestations
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Users control what data to share
- **Cross-Platform**: Credit score works across all applications

### **Implementation**

```typescript
import { IntuitionClient } from '@intuition/client';

const client = new IntuitionClient({
  apiKey: process.env.INTUITION_API_KEY,
  network: 'mainnet'
});

const financialProfile = await client.createAtom({
  type: 'financial_profile',
  content: {
    userId: user.id,
    totalAssets: 50000,
    debtRatio: 0.2,
    paymentHistory: 'excellent',
    timestamp: Date.now()
  }
});

const repaymentAttestation = await client.createTriple({
  subject: lender.id,
  predicate: 'ATTESTS_TO',
  object: financialProfile.id,
  metadata: {
    loanAmount: 10000,
    repaymentStatus: 'completed',
    onTimePayments: 12,
    latePayments: 0,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  }
});

const trustAttestation = await client.createTriple({
  subject: communityMember.id,
  predicate: 'ATTESTS_TO',
  object: financialProfile.id,
  metadata: {
    trustLevel: 'high',
    interactionHistory: 'positive',
    timestamp: Date.now()
  }
});

const calculateCreditScore = async (userId) => {
  const attestations = await client.query({
    triples: {
      object: userId,
      predicate: 'ATTESTS_TO',
      filters: {
        minReputation: 0.7
      }
    }
  });
  
  let score = 300;
  
  const repaymentHistory = attestations.filter(a => 
    a.metadata.repaymentStatus === 'completed'
  );
  score += repaymentHistory.length * 20;
  
  const trustAttestations = attestations.filter(a => 
    a.metadata.trustLevel === 'high'
  );
  score += trustAttestations.length * 10;
  
  const financialProfile = attestations.find(a => 
    a.metadata.debtRatio
  );
  if (financialProfile && financialProfile.metadata.debtRatio < 0.3) {
    score += 50;
  }
  
  return Math.min(score, 850);
};

const creditScore = await calculateCreditScore(user.id);
```

## Professional Reputation Network

Build a decentralized professional network where skills, experience, and endorsements are verified through community attestations.

### **What You'll Build**

A professional networking platform where skills and experience are verified through peer endorsements and institutional attestations, creating a trustless LinkedIn alternative.

### **Key Features**

- **Skill Verification**: Peers and institutions attest to skills
- **Experience Validation**: Employers verify work history
- **Endorsement System**: Community can endorse verified skills
- **Economic Incentives**: Rewards for quality endorsements

### **Implementation**

```typescript
import { IntuitionClient } from '@intuition/client';

const client = new IntuitionClient({
  apiKey: process.env.INTUITION_API_KEY,
  network: 'mainnet'
});

const professionalProfile = await client.createAtom({
  type: 'professional_profile',
  content: {
    userId: user.id,
    name: 'Alice Johnson',
    title: 'Senior Blockchain Developer',
    industry: 'technology',
    timestamp: Date.now()
  }
});

const skillAttestation = await client.createTriple({
  subject: employer.id,
  predicate: 'ATTESTS_TO',
  object: professionalProfile.id,
  metadata: {
    skill: 'smart_contract_development',
    proficiency: 'expert',
    duration: '3_years',
    projects: ['DeFi Protocol', 'NFT Marketplace'],
    timestamp: Date.now()
  }
});

const peerEndorsement = await client.createTriple({
  subject: peer.id,
  predicate: 'ENDORSES',
  object: skillAttestation.id,
  metadata: {
    reason: 'worked_together',
    confidence: 0.95,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  }
});

await client.signal({
  tripleId: peerEndorsement.id,
  direction: 'positive',
  amount: 100,
  metadata: {
    reason: 'quality_endorsement',
    userReputation: 0.88
  }
});

const getVerifiedSkills = async (userId) => {
  const skillAttestations = await client.query({
    triples: {
      object: userId,
      predicate: 'ATTESTS_TO',
      metadata: {
        skill: { $exists: true }
      },
      filters: {
        minSignals: 3,
        minReputation: 0.7
      }
    }
  });
  
  return skillAttestations.map(attestation => ({
    skill: attestation.metadata.skill,
    proficiency: attestation.metadata.proficiency,
    endorsements: attestation.signalStrength,
    verified: attestation.signalStrength > 0.8
  }));
};

const verifiedSkills = await getVerifiedSkills(user.id);
```
