# Overview

Welcome to the Intuition documentation — your gateway to building with the world's first open, semantic, and decentralized knowledge graph. 

Whether you're a developer, researcher, or curious user, this guide will help you understand Intuition's core concepts, how to interact with its data structures, and why it matters for the future of trust online.

## The Vision

Intuition's vision is to create a future where trust online is programmable, portable, and permissionless. We believe in a new digital infrastructure where:

### **Core Principles**

<div style={{ 
  background: 'var(--ifm-color-emphasis-100)',
  border: '2px solid var(--ifm-color-primary)',
  borderRadius: '12px', 
  padding: '24px', 
  margin: '20px 0',
  boxShadow: '0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)',
  color: 'var(--ifm-font-color-base)'
}}>

- **People and organizations can prove and discover knowledge across apps and ecosystems**
- **Social and factual claims are verifiable and incentive-aligned**
- **Developers have the tools to build collaborative, data-rich applications**

</div>

By refining, expressing, and managing identity and data, Intuition gives every entity better "intuition" in their digital interactions — ultimately enhancing the trustworthiness of the entire ecosystem.

## What is Intuition Building?

Intuition is building a powerful and versatile ecosystem of applications and developer tools on top of an open and semantic social + knowledge graph. This graph makes it easy to capture, curate, and share verifiable social wisdom — free from the limitations of application-specific silos. The platform is designed to:

- **Enhance the trustworthiness of digital interactions**
- **Empower individuals to own and manage their data**
- **Align incentives between users, developers, and platforms**
- **Enable programmable economic structures for decentralized identity**

At its core, Intuition enables a world where data is:

- **Verifiable**
- **Interoperable**
- **Economically incentivized**
