## With Atoms

- Triples connect Atoms into meaningful relationships
- Atoms gain context through Triple connections
- Triple predicates can themselves be Atoms for maximum flexibility

## With Signals

- Community validates Triples through Signal attestations
- Signal strength directly affects Triple credibility and consensus
