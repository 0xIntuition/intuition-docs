# Architecture Overview

Welcome to Intuition's architecture documentation. This section provides a comprehensive overview of how Intuition's various components work together to create a powerful and flexible system for building decentralized applications.

## System Components

Intuition's architecture is built around several key components that work together seamlessly:

- **Smart Contracts**: The foundation of our decentralized infrastructure
- **Primitives**: Core building blocks for creating complex applications
- **GraphQL Layer**: API interface for interacting with the system
- **AI Integration**: Intelligent processing and automation capabilities

## Architecture Sections

Dive deep into each aspect of our architecture:

- [Front-End Architecture](/guides/architecture/frontend) - Learn about our client-side implementation
- [Back-End Architecture](/guides/architecture/backend) - Understand our server infrastructure
- [Smart Contracts Architecture](/guides/smart-contracts/architecture) - Explore our blockchain integration

## High-Level Overview

Our architecture is designed to provide a seamless experience for both developers and end-users, with each component playing a crucial role in the ecosystem.
