# Why Intuition?

Intuition gives developers the tools to build next-generation Web3 applications by offering:

## Core Capabilities

- **Composability**: Easily integrate with existing Web3 infrastructure
- **Semantic structure**: Define meaningful relationships between entities  
- **Programmable incentives**: Earn rewards for creating and curating valuable information
- **Privacy and control**: Users manage their own identities and data access

## What You Can Build

- **Verifiable identities and claims**
- **Attestation-based trust systems**
- **Social graphs and knowledge layers**
- **Token-curated registries and information markets**

## Key Differentiators

- **Global Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)**: Canonical, cross-platform IDs for any entity — not just people
- **Traversable Attestations**: Semantic, many-to-one attestations that enhance discoverability
- **Data Neutrality Framework**: No gatekeepers; data can flow freely across the ecosystem
- **Universal Knowledge Graph**: Open, permissionless registry of meaningful information
- **Information Markets**: Incentives for creating and curating impactful, verifiable content

## What Makes Intuition Unique?

### Not Just Another Identity Platform

Intuition is a peer-to-peer knowledge sharing protocol — not a closed system. Key features:

- **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)** for any entity
- **Semantic Claims** formed using subject–predicate–object logic (Triples)
- **Permissionless staking and signaling** for truth curation
- **Portable, composable data** across any dApp or chain

## What Is the Portal?

The Portal is Intuition’s flagship application, providing a smooth interface for interacting with the protocol. Users can:

- **Create and manage Identities (Atoms)**
- **Make and explore Claims (Triples)**
- **Stake ETH to signal conviction**
- **View attestation histories and balances**

This is where end users interact with the knowledge graph, while developers can build their own interfaces on top.

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Identities (Atoms)** | Canonical representations of any entity — person, org, object, idea |
| **Claims (Triples)** | Verifiable statements connecting three Atoms: Subject → Predicate → Object |
| **Attestations** | Cryptographic signals of agreement or trust |
| **Staking** | Users stake ETH to express belief in a Claim or Identity — and can earn rewards |

## Data Security & Privacy

Intuition employs strong cryptographic standards to ensure data privacy, integrity, and transparency. Users own and control their data, and the system supports both public and permissioned usage models.



## Community & Support
