# $TRUST Tokenomics

$TRUST is the native token of the Intuition Network and Protocol, designed to enable economic participation in the decentralized knowledge graph.

## Token Purpose

The $TRUST token serves as the fundamental economic unit within Intuition, enabling:

- **Ownership in Data**: Stake $TRUST to acquire ownership shares in Atoms and Triples
- **Reward Mechanism**: Earn rewards as your contributed data gains traction and usage
- **Economic Signaling**: Express confidence in specific data points through token deposits
- **Network Incentives**: Align participant behavior with network growth and data quality

## Token Utility

### Staking and Ownership

When you deposit $TRUST into an Atom or Triple vault:
- You receive shares representing ownership in that data point
- Your ownership percentage determines your share of future rewards
- Early stakers benefit from lower prices on the bonding curve
- Ownership grants you economic exposure to data usage and popularity

### Earning Mechanisms

$TRUST holders can earn through:
- **Protocol Fees**: Distributed proportionally to data owners when others interact with their data
- **Network Effects**: More valuable data generates more fees for stakeholders
- **Early Adoption**: First movers capture outsized rewards for creating valuable identifiers
- **Compound Growth**: Reinvest rewards to increase ownership stakes

### Governance and Participation

While initially focused on economic participation, $TRUST may evolve to include:
- Protocol parameter governance
- Standards and schema proposals
- Community-driven ecosystem development
- Treasury allocation decisions

## Distribution Model

The $TRUST token distribution is designed to:
- Reward early contributors and builders
- Incentivize long-term network participation
- Support sustainable ecosystem growth
- Align stakeholder incentives with protocol success

## Staking Mechanisms

### Vault Deposits

Depositing $TRUST into vaults involves:
1. Selecting an Atom or Triple to stake on
2. Choosing deposit amount
3. Paying protocol fees (which reward existing stakeholders)
4. Receiving shares based on bonding curve pricing
5. Earning proportional rewards from future deposits

### Redemption

When withdrawing $TRUST:
- Redeem shares for underlying assets
- Price determined by bonding curve at redemption time
- May incur exit fees to stabilize vaults
- Reduces your ownership percentage in that data

## Economic Security

The token model provides security through:
- **Economic Disincentives**: Fees deter spam and malicious activity
- **Stake-Weighted Reputation**: Larger stakes signal stronger conviction
- **Attack Resistance**: Attacks inadvertently benefit the system through fee payments
- **Sustainable Incentives**: Self-funding model supports long-term viability
