# Intuition Monorepo Overview

The Intuition project is organized as a monorepo, which means all related packages and services are stored in a single repository. This approach provides several benefits, including:

- **Simplified dependency management** - shared dependencies are installed once
- **Consistent tooling** - all packages use the same development tools
- **Cross-package development** - easier to make changes that span multiple packages
- **Atomic commits** - changes across multiple packages can be committed together

## Repository Structure

The monorepo contains the following main directories:

- **`apps/`** - Frontend applications and services
- **`packages/`** - Shared libraries and utilities
- **`docs/`** - Documentation (where you are now)
- **`tools/`** - Development tools and scripts

## Development Workflow

Working in the monorepo allows you to develop across multiple packages simultaneously. Common workflows include:

1. Installing dependencies for the entire monorepo
2. Running tests across all packages
3. Building packages in the correct order based on dependencies

For detailed information about the architectural design of the monorepo, see [intuition-ts](/guides/intuition-monorepo/architecture) guide.
