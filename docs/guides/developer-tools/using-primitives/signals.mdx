# Signals

Signals are dynamic, time-based data streams that represent real-time information, events, and state changes within the Intuition system. They enable reactive applications and real-time collaboration.

## What are Signals?

Signals are continuous data streams that:

- **Update in Real-Time**: Reflect current state and changes as they happen
- **Carry Metadata**: Include timing, source, and context information
- **Support Subscriptions**: Allow applications to subscribe to specific signal types
- **Enable Reactivity**: Trigger automatic updates in connected systems

## Signal Types

### Event Signals
Signals that represent discrete events or actions:
- User interactions
- System events
- External API calls
- Smart contract events

### State Signals
Signals that represent continuous state information:
- Current prices
- Network status
- User presence
- System metrics

### Aggregate Signals
Signals that combine multiple data sources:
- Trending topics
- Popular content
- Network activity
- Economic indicators

## Creating Signals

### Signal Definition
Define the structure and behavior of your signal:

```javascript
const signalDefinition = {
  type: "price-update",
  schema: {
    price: "number",
    timestamp: "string",
    source: "string"
  },
  updateFrequency: "realtime"
}
```

### Signal Sources
Signals can originate from:
- Smart contract events
- User interactions
- External APIs
- System monitoring
- Other signals (signal composition)

## Using Signals

### Subscribing to Signals
Applications can subscribe to specific signals to receive real-time updates.

### Signal Processing
Process and transform signals to extract meaningful information.

### Signal Composition
Combine multiple signals to create more complex data streams.

## Signal Patterns

### Filtering
Filter signals based on specific criteria or conditions.

### Aggregation
Combine multiple signals to create summary information.

### Transformation
Transform signal data into different formats or structures.

### Routing
Route signals to different destinations based on content or rules.

## Best Practices

1. **Efficient Updates**: Minimize unnecessary signal updates
2. **Clear Schema**: Define clear schemas for signal data
3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for signal processing
4. **Performance**: Consider performance implications of signal subscriptions
5. **Security**: Validate signal sources and content

## Examples

```javascript
// Subscribing to a price signal
const priceSubscription = subscribeToSignal("price-update", {
  filter: (signal) => signal.price > 100,
  onUpdate: (signal) => {
    console.log(`Price updated: ${signal.price}`);
    updateUI(signal);
  }
});
```
