# Intuition

> Intuition is a permissionless protocol for creating verifiable, tokenized attestations on a Layer 3 blockchain. Developers build context-aware applications using semantic triples (subject-predicate-object relationships) backed by economic incentives through bonding curves. The three core primitives are Atoms (universal identifiers), Triples (structured claims), and Signals (staked conviction).
