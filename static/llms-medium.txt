# Overview

## Intuition at a Glance

Intuition is a decentralized system that makes attestations viable as a meta for digital expression.

A universal language for signed data.

Instead of information living as unstructured, siloed, minimally-attributable data in Web2 platforms, Intuition turns information into verifiable, tokenized, and portable objects that can flow across apps, chains, and agents.

The result is a Semantic Web of Trust, powered the world's first token-curated knowledge graph — a network where information isn't just stored, but structured, incentivized, and made usable for developers and AI systems alike — all while maintaining verifiable provenance and attribution.

# Use Cases

![Use Cases](/img/use-cases.png)

This article outlines use cases that take advantage of Intuition's unique knowledge graph and claim infrastructure. There are many more ways to use Intuition (and we would love to see what you come up with!), but here are some ideas to get you started.

# Why Intuition?

> **Every interaction online is an attestation.**
> A review or a purchase on Amazon, a comment on Reddit, the watching of a show on Netflix, a retweet, a LinkedIn endorsement, a 'follow', a bookmark, the ordering of an Uber, even a "like" — all are forms of attestations: claims made by things about things.

But attestations today are fragmented, unverifiable, and platform-locked. They don't move with you. They don't carry weight. They aren't semantically structured and unambiguously consumable by machines.

**Intuition changes that.** We've rebuilt attestations as first-class, tokenized primitives — structured, portable, and economically backed. _Attestations on steroids._

title: "Choose Appropriate Operators"
description: "Use the right comparison operator for the job"
last_updated: "2026-01-05T17:16:01-08:00"
source: "https://docs.intuition.systems/docs/graphql-api/best-practices/comparison-operators"
---

# Choose Appropriate Operators

Use the right comparison operator for better performance.

## Anti-Pattern

## Best Practice

## Operator Guidelines

- **_eq**: Exact matches (fastest)
- **_ilike**: Case-insensitive pattern matching (slower)
- **_in**: Multiple values
- **_gt/_lt**: Comparisons
- **Primary key lookup**: Most efficient (when possible)

---
title: "Use Database Functions"
description: "Leverage backend functions for complex queries"
last_updated: "2026-01-05T17:16:01-08:00"
source: "https://docs.intuition.systems/docs/graphql-api/best-practices/database-functions"
---

# Use Database Functions

Use backend functions for complex queries instead of client-side filtering.

## Anti-Pattern

## Best Practice

## Available Functions

- `following`: Get accounts a user follows
- `positions_from_following`: Social feed of positions
- `search_term`: Semantic search
- `signals_from_following`: Activity from followed accounts

## Benefits

1. **Faster execution**: Runs in database
2. **Less data transfer**: Filtered server-side
3. **More maintainable**: Logic in one place

last_updated: "2026-01-05T17:16:01-08:00"
source: "https://docs.intuition.systems/docs/graphql-api/best-practices/error-handling"
---

# Error Handling

Handle GraphQL errors gracefully in your application.

## Error Structure

## Error Types

- **validation-failed**: Query syntax or schema validation error
- **constraint-violation**: Database constraint violated
- **unexpected**: Internal server error

## Best Practice

## Tips

1. **Check errors array**: GraphQL can return partial data with errors
2. **Log error details**: Include query and variables for debugging
3. **Show user-friendly messages**: Don't expose internal errors
4. **Implement retry logic**: For network failures

title: "Efficient Filtering"
description: "Use indexed fields and appropriate operators"
last_updated: "2026-01-05T17:16:01-08:00"
source: "https://docs.intuition.systems/docs/graphql-api/best-practices/filtering"
---

# Efficient Filtering

Filter early and use indexed fields for better performance.

## Best Practice

## Indexed Fields

These fields have database indexes:
- `term_id` (primary key)
- `creator_id`
- `type`
- `created_at`

## Operator Selection

- Use `_eq` for exact matches (not `_ilike`)
- Use `_ilike` only for pattern matching
- Use `_in` for multiple values
- Combine filters with `_and` for specificity

---
title: "Use Fragments"
description: "Reuse field selections with GraphQL fragments"
last_updated: "2026-01-05T17:16:01-08:00"
source: "https://docs.intuition.systems/docs/graphql-api/best-practices/fragments"
---

# Use Fragments

Reuse field selections across queries with GraphQL fragments.

## Anti-Pattern

## Best Practice

## Benefits

1. **DRY code**: Define once, use everywhere
2. **Easier maintenance**: Update in one place
3. **Consistent data**: Same fields across queries
4. **Better readability**: Named, semantic units

---
title: "Pagination Best Practices"

last_updated: "2026-01-05T17:16:01-08:00"
source: "https://docs.intuition.systems/docs/graphql-api/best-practices/pagination"
---

# Pagination Best Practices

Always use limit and offset for efficient pagination with consistent ordering.

## Best Practice

## Key Points

1. **Always include order_by** for consistent results
2. **Fetch total count** using aggregates
3. **Use reasonable limits** (10-100 items per page)
4. **Calculate offset** as `(page - 1) * limit`

---

# Query Performance

Optimize your GraphQL queries for better performance.

## Performance Checklist

### 1. Use Indexed Fields for Filtering

**Indexed fields:**
- `term_id` (primary keys)
- `creator_id`
- `type`
- `created_at`
- `account_id`

### 2. Request Only Needed Fields

### 3. Use Aggregates Instead of Fetching All Nodes

### 4. Limit Nested Queries

### 5. Use Primary Key Lookups When Possible

### 6. Paginate Large Result Sets

### 7. Use Pre-Computed Tables

### 8. Leverage Database Functions

## Monitoring

- Profile query execution time
- Monitor response payload sizes
- Track cache hit rates
- Watch for N+1 query patterns

source: "https://docs.intuition.systems/docs/graphql-api/best-practices/pre-computed-stats"
---

# Use Pre-Computed Statistics

Leverage time-series aggregation tables for efficient analytics.

## Anti-Pattern

## Best Practice

## Available Tables

- `share_price_change_stats_hourly/daily/weekly/monthly`
- `signal_stats_hourly/daily/monthly`

## Benefits

1. **Faster queries**: Pre-aggregated data
2. **Less computation**: Done server-side
3. **Smaller payloads**: Aggregated vs raw data
4. **Better UX**: Faster dashboard loading

---
title: "Request Only Needed Fields"
description: "Avoid over-fetching by requesting only required fields"
last_updated: "2026-01-05T17:16:01-08:00"
source: "https://docs.intuition.systems/docs/graphql-api/best-practices/request-only-needed"
---

# Request Only Needed Fields

Avoid over-fetching by requesting only the fields you actually need.

## Anti-Pattern

## Best Practice

## Benefits

1. **Faster queries**: Less data to fetch and serialize
2. **Reduced bandwidth**: Smaller response payloads
3. **Lower memory usage**: Less data to process client-side
4. **Better caching**: Smaller cache footprints

## Tips

- Start minimal and add fields as needed
- Remove unused fields from queries
- Use fragments for commonly requested field sets
- Profile queries to identify over-fetching

source: "https://docs.intuition.systems/docs/graphql-api/best-practices/subscriptions-vs-polling"
---

# Subscriptions vs Polling

Choose the right approach for your data update needs.

## Use Subscriptions When

- Building real-time dashboards
- Monitoring live protocol activity
- Data changes frequently (multiple times per minute)
- User expects immediate updates
- Creating notification systems

**Example:**

## Use Polling When

- Data updates infrequently (e.g., daily statistics)
- Real-time updates aren't critical for UX
- Minimizing server connections is important
- Building static reports or analytics

**Example:**

## Guidelines

- **Polling interval**: 30-60 seconds for most use cases
- **Subscription batch_size**: 10-50 items
- **Handle reconnections**: Store last cursor for resumability

last_updated: "2026-01-05T17:16:01-08:00"
source: "https://docs.intuition.systems/docs/graphql-api/best-practices/variables"
---

# Use Variables

Always use variables for dynamic values instead of hardcoding.

## Anti-Pattern

## Best Practice

**Variables:**

## Benefits

1. **Reusability**: Same query, different values
2. **Type safety**: GraphQL validates variable types
3. **Security**: Prevents injection attacks
4. **Caching**: Better query plan caching

# Introduction

# GraphQL API Introduction

The Intuition GraphQL API provides comprehensive access to the Intuition knowledge graph, including atoms (entities), triples (relationships), vaults (asset pools), and user positions. The API is powered by Hasura and offers rich querying capabilities with filtering, sorting, pagination, and aggregations.

## Public Endpoints

No authentication required to access the GraphQL API:

- **Mainnet**: `https://mainnet.intuition.sh/v1/graphql`
- **Testnet**: `https://testnet.intuition.sh/v1/graphql`

## Interactive Explorers

Explore the API interactively with Apollo Studio Sandbox:

# Schema Reference

The Intuition GraphQL API is powered by Hasura, providing a rich set of features for querying and manipulating data.

## Getting the Schema

Generate the GraphQL schema via introspection:

This schema file can be used with code generation tools to create type-safe clients.

## Filtering with `where` Clauses

Use boolean expressions to filter query results:

### Available Operators

**Equality**:
- `_eq` - Equal to
- `_neq` - Not equal to

**Comparisons**:
- `_gt` - Greater than
- `_gte` - Greater than or equal to
- `_lt` - Less than
- `_lte` - Less than or equal to

**Array Operations**:

# Migrating GraphQL from v1.5 to v2.0

## Overview

| Environment | Endpoint |
|-------------|----------|
| **Intuition Testnet** | `https://testnet.intuition.sh/v1/graphql` |

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

### 1. ID Field Type Changes: Numeric → String

**CRITICAL IMPACT** - All existing queries and mutations using these fields will break.

#### Core Entity ID Changes

| Entity        | Field             | Old Type   | New Type  |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| `accounts`    | `atom_id`         | `numeric`  | `String`  |
| `atoms`       | `term_id`         | `numeric!` | `String!` |
| `atoms`       | `value_id`        | `numeric`  | `String`  |

## GraphQL Mutations

Our GraphQL API provides convenient mutations to help structure and publish Atom metadata following common schemas and best practices. While the protocol supports any URI scheme, these mutations offer an opinionated approach to creating well-structured, interoperable data.

## Current Schema Support

Our GraphQL API provides mutations for uploading structured metadata following common schemas. The primary mutation is `pinThing` which uploads metadata to IPFS following the **Thing schema**.

### pinThing Mutation

### Example Usage

### Variables Example

The mutation returns an IPFS URI that can be used when creating an Atom:

# Introduction

**Intuition is a decentralized protocol for building the world's first open, semantic, and token-curated knowledge graph.** It provides the infrastructure for verifiable attestations, portable identity, and trustful interactions at scale—creating a universal data layer that enables information to flow freely across applications, blockchains, and AI agents.

## What is Intuition?
While blockchains have historically decentralized money, **Intuition decentralizes information**—specifically its trust, ownership, discoverability, and monetization. By transforming unstructured, siloed data into structured, verifiable, and economically-backed attestations, Intuition creates a Semantic Web of Trust that makes knowledge programmable and interoperable.

# Overview

# Contract Interactions Overview

The Intuition protocol's smart contracts manage complex state involving Atoms, Triples, and their associated vaults. When interacting with these primitives, we recommend retrieving state data directly from the EthMultiVault contract.

## Key Concepts

<h4 >Multicall Operations</h4>

Batch multiple read-only contract calls into a single request to reduce RPC calls and improve performance.

<h4 >State Management</h4>

Retrieve comprehensive vault information including assets, share prices, and user positions.

# Retrieve Vault Details

The Intuition protocol's EthMultiVault contract manages complex state involving Atoms, Triples, and their associated vaults. When interacting with these primitives, we recommend retrieving the state data directly from the EthMultiVault contract.

We utilize multicall operations that batch multiple read-only contract calls into a single request. This approach significantly reduces RPC calls and provides data you'll need for contract interactions, such as the `atomCost` that is referenced in the contract interaction guides.

- **MultiVault System**: Atom and Triple vaults
- **Bonding Curves**: Price discovery mechanisms
- **ERC-1155 Tokens**: Atom and Triple representations

### Layer 2: Off-Chain Data
- **IPFS/Arweave**: Decentralized storage for Atom data
- **DIDs**: Decentralized identifier resolution
- **Metadata**: Rich context and descriptions

### Layer 3: Indexing & Query
- **GraphQL API**: Efficient data querying

# Bonding Curves

Bonding curves are a core economic primitive in Intuition, determining how the price of shares changes as more users stake tokens in Atom and Triple vaults.

## What is a Bonding Curve?

A bonding curve is a mathematical function that defines the relationship between the supply of tokens and their price. In Intuition:

- Price increases as more tokens are staked
- Price decreases as tokens are withdrawn
- Creates continuous liquidity
- Eliminates need for order books

## How Bonding Curves Work

### Basic Mechanics

1. **Initial Price**: First stake gets shares at base price

# Fees and Rewards

# Fees & Rewards

In the Intuition system, interactions incur fees similar to gas costs in blockchain transactions. These fees serve critical roles in maintaining system integrity, incentivizing contributions, and fostering high-quality data.

## Purpose of Fees

### Preventing Abuse and Attacks

Decentralized systems face risks such as Sybil and DoS attacks. Intuition mitigates these through economic disincentives:

- Fees deter malicious activity by imposing costs
- Network resilience: attacks inadvertently benefit the system through fee payments
- Similar to how Ethereum benefits from all transaction fees

Economic incentives motivate meaningful contributions:

# Incentive Design

Intuition's economic model is carefully designed to solve fundamental challenges in decentralized knowledge systems: fragmentation, quality control, and consensus formation.

## Reducing Fragmentation

In many systems, user-generated tags and classifications, known as **folksonomies**, can lead to fragmented and disorganized data. Different people might use different labels for the same thing, making it hard to gather or analyze information effectively. Intuition solves this by encouraging users to converge on a common set of identifiers.

# Economics

# Economics Overview

Intuition is built on the idea that information deserves its own decentralized distribution and financial rails.

Just as blockchains turned money into programmable assets, Intuition turns information into tokenized, ownable, and composable units that anyone can create and monetize in.

At the core are Atoms (entities) and Triples (relationships). As users publish, curate, and stake on these objects, they generate a token-curated knowledge graph where ownership weights are represented by positions in $TRUST — the native token of the Intuition Network and Protocol.

# $TRUST Tokenomics

$TRUST is the native token of the Intuition Network and Protocol, designed to enable economic participation in the decentralized knowledge graph.

## Token Purpose

The $TRUST token serves as the fundamental economic unit within Intuition, enabling:

- **Ownership in Data**: Stake $TRUST to acquire ownership shares in Atoms and Triples
- **Reward Mechanism**: Earn rewards as your contributed data gains traction and usage
- **Economic Signaling**: Express confidence in specific data points through token deposits
- **Network Incentives**: Align participant behavior with network growth and data quality

# Atom Best Practices

This guide provides comprehensive best practices for creating effective, reusable Atoms that contribute to a high-quality Intuition knowledge graph.

## Creating Effective Atoms

### 1. Leverage Deterministic IDs

Remember that identical atomData will always produce the same Atom ID. This ensures:
- No duplicate Atoms for the same data
- Predictable, verifiable identifiers
- Consistent references across the network

### 2. Check for Similar Atoms

Before creating new Atoms, search for existing canonical Atoms:
- Reduces fragmentation
- Leverages existing Signal
- Improves data consistency
- Benefits from accumulated trust

### 3. Use Clear, Descriptive Data

Think of Intuition as a vast, collaborative dictionary where anyone can create a new word, and each word has its own globally persistent, unique digital identifier that can be used to reference it across the entire internet.

## What are Atoms?

A system facilitating the arrival at social consensus around globally persistent canonical identifiers for all things demands that these identifiers possess a few key attributes.

# Atom Structuring

Understanding how to properly structure Atoms is crucial for building effective applications on the Intuition protocol. This guide covers advanced techniques and patterns for creating well-designed, reusable Atoms.

## Design Principles: Atomic Granularity

A crucial best practice is keeping information modular and atomic. You are economically incentivized to create "flatter" Atoms – each representing a single, minimal concept – rather than packing composite information into one Atom.

### Why Granularity Matters

Consider representing the statement: **"Tiger Research was founded in 2021"**

#### Monolithic Approach (Not Recommended)

Problems with this approach:

# Capturing Signal

This guide covers advanced techniques for capturing signal from users and interpreting signal data within the Intuition ecosystem.

## Signal Capture Mechanisms

### Direct Staking
Users explicitly deposit tokens to signal support or opposition:

### Continuous Markets

Staking is not a one-time vote but a continuous market:
- Add more stake to increase your signal
- Withdraw stake (with potential rewards or penalties)
- Counter-stake on opposite sides for Triples
- Market "odds" constantly adjust to reflect aggregated beliefs

## Interpreting Signal Strength

### Analyzing TVL (Total Value Locked)

Higher TVL generally indicates:
- Greater community interest

# Signal Fundamentals

Signals represent the trust, confidence, or relevance that the community assigns to Atoms and Triples in the Intuition knowledge graph. Think of the knowledge graph as a weighted graph where Signal is the weight on each node (Atom) or edge (Triple), indicating how strongly people believe in or care about this information.

## Understanding Signals

Signal, in the context of Intuition, refers to any action or indication that expresses intent, belief, or support. Signals can be classified into three broad categories: explicit signal, implicit signal, and transitive signal.

# Signal Rewards

Understanding the economic incentives and reward mechanisms is crucial for participating effectively in the Intuition signal economy.

## Fee Structure

### Entry Fees
When a user deposits tokens into an Atom or Triple vault:
- A small fee is charged on the deposit
- Fee goes to existing vault shareholders
- Incentivizes early discovery and staking

### Exit Fees
When a user withdraws their stake:
- A fee may be charged on redemption
- Helps stabilize the vault
- Discourages rapid speculation

### Protocol Fees
A portion of fees goes to:
- Protocol treasury
- Development funding
- Network maintenance

# Triple Fundamentals

If Atoms are the words in Intuition's global dictionary, Triples are the sentences we create from those words. A Triple connects three Atoms to assert a relationship or fact in the form **[Subject] – [Predicate] – [Object]**.

## Understanding Triples

A Triple is a fundamental data structure that expresses relationships between Atoms, following the classic RDF triple format used in semantic web technologies. This makes Intuition's data inherently machine-readable and structured.

# Nested Triples

# Nested Triples: Meta-Claims & Context

One of Intuition's most powerful features is that Triples can reference other Triples, effectively nesting statements to provide context or provenance. Intuition supports using a Triple itself as a Subject or Object in another Triple.

## Understanding Nested Triples

Think of it as linguistic compression—instead of repeatedly expressing complex relationships, you create them once and reference them by ID. A Triple about "Alice's employment at a specific company with particular conditions" becomes a single referenceable unit.

# Triple Structuring

Understanding how to properly structure Triples is essential for building rich, queryable knowledge graphs. This guide covers techniques for creating well-designed semantic relationships.

## Basic Triple Structure

## Triple Categories

### 1. Property Triples
Describe attributes or characteristics of entities.

**Example**: "Ethereum is decentralized"

### 2. Relationship Triples
Connect entities through specific relationships.

**Example**: "Vitalik Buterin created Ethereum"

### 3. Classification Triples
Establish hierarchical or categorical relationships.

**Example**: "Machine Learning is a subset of AI"

## Creating Triples Programmatically

### Using the SDK

# Primitives

# Primitives Overview

Intuition's data model is built on three fundamental primitives that work together to create a rich, self-regulating knowledge graph. These primitives form the foundation of the ecosystem and enable the creation of a structured, semantic web of trust.

<h2>Atoms</h2>

The basic entities or identifiers - unique decentralized identifiers for everything in existence. Think of them as the nodes in the knowledge graph, or the words in the dictionary. Atoms are Intuition's atomic unit of knowledge, enabling unique, persistent, canonical identifiers for all things - not just people.

<h2>Triples</h2>

# Trust Mechanisms Overview

Intuition creates a decentralized trust layer through its primitives and economic incentives. This guide explains how trust emerges and is validated in the system.

## Many-to-One Attestations

Unlike traditional systems where a single authority issues certificates or attestations, Intuition enables **many-to-one non-deterministic attestations**:

### Key Characteristics

- **Multiple Validators**: Any number of users can signal their belief
- **Weighted Consensus**: Aggregate signal determines confidence level
- **No Single Point of Failure**: Truth emerges from collective validation
- **Dynamic Evolution**: Attestations change as new information emerges

## Trust Generation Mechanisms

### Explicit Trust
Direct attestations through staking:

This guide helps you migrate your code from v1.x to v2.0.0-alpha of the Intuition TypeScript packages. This is a **major version update** with significant breaking changes due to the underlying contract migration from `EthMultiVault` to `MultiVault`.

## Contract Migration Overview

The core smart contract has been upgraded from `EthMultiVault` to `MultiVault`, introducing significant architectural changes that impact all TypeScript libraries built on top.

### Key Contract Changes

#### 1. **ID System Migration**

- **EthMultiVault**: Uses `uint256` for atom/triple IDs
- **MultiVault**: Uses `bytes32` for term IDs (atoms and triples are now "terms")

# Overview

# Contract Architecture Overview

Intuition's smart contracts are central to the user experience, handling critical onchain activities such as the creation of Atoms (also known as Identities) and Triples (also known as Claims), as well as the staking and rewards.

# MultiVault

The MultiVault contract is the core component of Intuition's architecture, responsible for managing the creation of Atoms/Triples and handling deposits, redemptions, and share distributions. It supports multiple bonding curve implementations through a registry system.

- **Creation**: Users can create Atoms and Triples
- **Deposits**: Users can deposit ETH to receive shares in atoms/triples

# MultiVault.sol

The MultiVault contract is the core economic engine of the Intuition protocol, managing deposits, redemptions, and creation of atoms and triples. It implements a sophisticated vault system that supports multiple bonding curves and provides the foundation for the protocol's economic incentives.

The MultiVault is the primary interface for users to interact with the economic aspects of atoms and triples:

### Atom IDs
Atom IDs are generated using a hash function that hashes the Atom's data.

### Triple IDs
Triple IDs are generated using a hash function that hashes the subject, predicate, and object Atom IDs.

# TrustBonding.sol

The TrustBonding contract is the primary smart contract for bonding/staking of TRUST tokens within the Intuition protocol. Responsible for managing emissions of new TRUST tokens for various stakeholders, including atom creators, triple creators, and other participants in the ecosystem.

### Wrapped Trust (wTRUST)
The TrustBonding contract requires users to wrap their TRUST tokens into Wrapped TRUST (wTRUST) before locking them in the voting escrow. This wrapping process is handled by the `WrappedTrust` contract, which allows users to deposit TRUST tokens and receive an equivalent amount of wTRUST tokens.

# Portal (Explorer) Guide

# The Intuition Portal

The Portal is Intuition's first Explorer (akin to a block explorer), which provides users with easy access to the social and knowledge graph. Positioned at the application layer, the Portal offers an intuitive interface for users to create, manage, and interact with Identities (Atoms) and Claims (Triples). It serves as the gateway for creating decentralized identities, making claims, and managing your stake, transforming the exploration of the knowledge graph into an accessible and user-friendly experience.

The Intuition Protocol operates on an **epoch-based system** for tracking bonding rewards and vault utilization. Epochs are fixed time periods that determine reward distribution.

## What are Epochs?

An epoch is a fixed time period used to:
- Track vault utilization across the protocol
- Calculate and distribute bonding rewards
- Measure user activity and participation
- Determine APY and reward eligibility

# Vaults & Shares

Every atom and triple has an associated **vault** that holds deposited assets. Users receive **shares** representing their ownership when they deposit, with prices determined by bonding curves.

## What is a Vault?

A vault is a container for assets associated with an atom or triple:

- **Assets**: Total deposited value (in native token)
- **Shares**: Tokenized ownership stakes
- **Share Price**: Determined by bonding curve
- **Vault ID**: Same as the atom/triple ID

## Depositing to Vaults

### Basic Deposit

### Preview Deposit

Check expected shares before depositing:

### Batch Deposits

Deposit to multiple vaults in one transaction:

### ReadConfig (Read-Only Operations)

For querying data without submitting transactions:

### WriteConfig (Transaction Operations)

For operations that modify blockchain state:

## Network Configuration

### Intuition Testnet

The testnet is ideal for development and testing:

### Intuition Mainnet

For production deployments:

## Contract Addresses

### MultiVault Contract

The MultiVault is the main protocol contract for atoms, triples, and vaults:

# Protocol Package Overview

The `@0xintuition/protocol` package is a comprehensive TypeScript/JavaScript SDK for interacting with the Intuition onchain knowledge graph. It provides low-level access to build, query, and manage atoms (entities), triples (statements), vaults, and bonding rewards on the Intuition blockchain.

## What is the Protocol Package?

The Protocol package is built on top of [viem](https://viem.sh), providing type-safe, performant access to all Intuition smart contracts. It handles:

- **Atom Management**: Create and query entities (people, organizations, concepts)
- **Triple Management**: Create statements connecting atoms (subject-predicate-object)
- **Vault Operations**: Deposit and redeem assets, manage shares
- **Trust Bonding**: Participate in epoch-based rewards and staking
