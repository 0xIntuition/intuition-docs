# Overview

Welcome to the Intuition documentation ‚Äî your gateway to building with the world's first open, semantic, and decentralized knowledge graph. 

Whether you're a developer, researcher, or curious user, this guide will help you understand Intuition's core concepts, how to interact with its data structures, and why it matters for the future of trust online.

## The Vision

Intuition's vision is to create a future where trust online is programmable, portable, and permissionless. We believe in a new digital infrastructure where:

### **Core Principles**

- **People and organizations can prove and discover knowledge across apps and ecosystems**
- **Social and factual claims are verifiable and incentive-aligned**
- **Developers have the tools to build collaborative, data-rich applications**

By refining, expressing, and managing identity and data, Intuition gives every entity better "intuition" in their digital interactions ‚Äî ultimately enhancing the trustworthiness of the entire ecosystem.

## What is Intuition Building?

Intuition is building a powerful and versatile ecosystem of applications and developer tools on top of an open and semantic social + knowledge graph. This graph makes it easy to capture, curate, and share verifiable social wisdom ‚Äî free from the limitations of application-specific silos.

### **Core Capabilities**

#### **Universal Knowledge Graph**
- **Decentralized Data Storage**: Store and retrieve data across multiple chains and storage solutions
- **Semantic Relationships**: Create meaningful connections between any entities or concepts
- **Permissionless Access**: Open access to all data while maintaining privacy controls
- **Cross-Platform Integration**: Seamlessly work across different applications and ecosystems

#### **Trust Infrastructure**
- **Verifiable Claims**: Create and verify attestations about any subject
- **Reputation Systems**: Build trust scores based on community consensus
- **Identity Management**: Manage decentralized identities with full user control
- **Fraud Prevention**: Detect and prevent malicious activities through collective intelligence

#### **Economic Incentives**
- **Tokenized Data Ownership**: Own and monetize your contributions to the knowledge graph
- **Early Adopter Rewards**: Benefit from being first to contribute valuable information
- **Community Governance**: Participate in protocol decisions and improvements
- **Sustainable Ecosystem**: Long-term economic model that benefits all participants

## The Intuition System

Intuition is an ecosystem of technologies composing a universal and permissionless knowledge graph, capable of handling both objective facts and subjective opinions. Intuition's vertically integrated knowledge stack offers a comprehensive suite of developer tooling to streamline the development of the next generation of technologies powered by humanity's collective intuition.

Intuition's open social knowledge graph is built to harness collective wisdom in a **structured, permissionless, and fully decentralized** manner. The system's resulting state is open and accessible to everyone, enabling limitless use cases and expanding the information available about the countless entities we engage with daily‚Äîwhether it's a pseudonym, a smart contract, an organization, or a piece of content.

### **How It Works**

#### **Data Creation & Storage**
1. **Atoms**: Create unique identifiers for any entity (people, concepts, products)
2. **Triples**: Build relationships between atoms to express complex statements
3. **Signals**: Add weight and credibility through community attestations
4. **Vaults**: Store economic value tied to data ownership and contributions

#### **Knowledge Discovery**
1. **Semantic Search**: Find information based on meaning, not just keywords
2. **Relationship Mapping**: Discover connections between entities and concepts
3. **Trust Filtering**: Filter results based on community consensus and reputation
4. **Cross-Platform Aggregation**: Combine data from multiple sources seamlessly

#### **Economic Participation**
1. **Contribute Data**: Earn rewards for adding valuable information
2. **Curate Content**: Get paid for helping organize and validate information
3. **Build Applications**: Create tools that leverage the knowledge graph
4. **Govern Protocol**: Participate in decisions about system improvements

### State of the Graph

The Intuition system leverages a combination of on and off chain interactions to create, store, and manage data within the Intuition knowledge graph:

#### **On-Chain State**

The on-chain state of Intuition is composed of the nodes, edges, and weights of the Intuition Graph:

- **Atoms**: Point to any arbitrary URI, their associated Smart Contract Wallets, and their respective Vaults
- **Triples**: Composed of 3 Atoms with positive and negative Vaults for attestations For and Against
- **Signals**: Representative of 'who is attesting to what' through vault balances
- **Unified System State**: The nodes, edges, and weights of the knowledge graph

#### **Off-Chain State**

All Atoms point to some arbitrary URI, meaning the on-chain state can represent any on-chain or off-chain data. This means Intuition can reference anything across the web‚Äîa Medium publication, a Spotify song, an IPFS CID, a Ceramic Stream, an ETH address‚Äîanything with an associated URI can be mapped on Intuition.

The **Intuition Backend** indexes the on-chain and off-chain state, unifying it into a singular, traversable knowledge graph that can be easily queried and replicated locally.

### The Trust Protocol

The Intuition protocol provides the infrastructure for a new information economy, using cryptoeconomic incentives to promote the expression, structuring, and curation of high-quality, semantic data. The protocol is designed to promote:

1. **The creation of useful data**
2. **Convergence on universal canonical identifiers for all things**
3. **Convergence on data standards, schemas, and formats**

Intuition can be thought of as a consensus mechanism for the 'state of the state' of decentralized systems, allowing distributed consensus on the language spoken on top of the system‚Äîpursuing the realization of the Semantic Web.

## What is Intuition Building?

Intuition is building a powerful and versatile ecosystem of applications and developer tools on top of an open and semantic social + knowledge graph. This graph makes it easy to capture, curate, and share verifiable social wisdom ‚Äî free from the limitations of application-specific silos. The platform is designed to:

- **Enhance the trustworthiness of digital interactions**
- **Empower individuals to own and manage their data**
- **Align incentives between users, developers, and platforms**
- **Enable programmable economic structures for decentralized identity**

At its core, Intuition enables a world where data is:
