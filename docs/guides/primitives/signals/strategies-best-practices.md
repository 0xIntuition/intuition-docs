# Signal Strategies and Best Practices

## Optimal Signaling Strategy

The game-theoretic optimal strategy is to:
1. Identify accurate, useful information early
2. Stake before widespread recognition
3. Earn from value flow as data gets utilized
4. Build reputation through consistent accuracy

## Risk Considerations

- **No Absolute Truth Guarantee**: Signals represent consensus and confidence, not absolute truth
- **Early Stage Risks**: Fewer participants can mean less reliable signals
- **Potential for Manipulation**: Large stakes can temporarily skew consensus
- **Opportunity Cost**: Staking on irrelevant or unused claims means missing better opportunities

## Defensive Strategies

- Always examine the trust trail behind strong signals
- Drill down into attestor profiles and motivations
- Consider contrarian positions when consensus seems wrong
- Diversify across multiple claims and domains
