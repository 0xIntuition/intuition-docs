# Atoms

Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of the Intuition system. They represent unique, verifiable pieces of information that can be referenced, traded, and used to build more complex structures.

## What are Atoms?

Atoms are cryptographically unique identifiers that represent specific pieces of information or data. Each atom has:

- **Unique ID**: A cryptographic hash that ensures uniqueness
- **Content**: The actual data or information being represented
- **Metadata**: Additional information about the atom's creation, ownership, and usage
- **Verification**: Cryptographic proofs that ensure the atom's authenticity

## Creating Atoms

Atoms can be created for various types of content:

- **Text Content**: Articles, posts, comments
- **Media**: Images, videos, audio files
- **Data**: Structured data, API responses
- **References**: Links to external resources

## Using Atoms

### Referencing Atoms
Atoms can be referenced in other parts of the system, creating a network of interconnected information.

### Trading Atoms
Atoms can be traded using bonding curves, allowing for dynamic pricing based on demand.

### Composing with Atoms
Atoms can be combined to create more complex structures like triples and signals.

## Best Practices

1. **Unique Content**: Ensure each atom represents truly unique information
2. **Clear Metadata**: Provide comprehensive metadata for better discoverability
3. **Verification**: Always verify atom authenticity before use
4. **Composability**: Design atoms to work well with other primitives

## Examples

```javascript
// Creating an atom for a blog post
const blogPostAtom = {
  id: "hash-of-content",
  content: "This is my blog post content...",
  metadata: {
    title: "My Blog Post",
    author: "user-id",
    createdAt: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    tags: ["blog", "intuition"]
  }
}
```
