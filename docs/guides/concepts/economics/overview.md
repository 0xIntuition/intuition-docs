# Economics Overview

Intuition is built on the idea that information deserves its own decentralized distribution and financial rails.

Just as blockchains turned money into programmable assets, Intuition turns information into tokenized, ownable, and composable units that anyone can create and monetize in.

At the core are Atoms (entities) and Triples (relationships). As users publish, curate, and stake on these objects, they generate a token-curated knowledge graph where ownership weights are represented by positions in $TRUST — the native token of the Intuition Network and Protocol.

## The Vision

The economics of Intuition transform every digital interaction into an economic opportunity. Every like, comment, review, connection, and action you take across the web becomes an economic bet, allowing you to buy meaningful ownership in any piece of data.

The goal is not to tokenize data just for the sake of a token. The economics of Intuition are designed to:

<div className="uniform-card">
<h3 className="uniform-card-title">1. Incentivize Expression</h3>
<ul style={{ margin: 0, paddingLeft: '1.2rem', fontSize: '0.95rem', lineHeight: '1.6' }}>
<li>Users are rewarded for making useful, verifiable attestations</li>
<li>First movers capture outsized rewards for creating identifiers or relationships that prove valuable</li>
<li>The system pays people to contribute knowledge, not just consume it</li>

<h3 className="uniform-card-title">2. Incentivize Convergence on Canonical Identifiers</h3>
<ul style={{ margin: 0, paddingLeft: '1.2rem', fontSize: '0.95rem', lineHeight: '1.6' }}>
<li>Anyone can permissionlessly create a decentralized identifier (DID) for anything</li>
<li>Instead of fragmenting into infinite duplicates, bonding curves and network effects encourage participants to converge on shared canonical identifiers</li>
<li>This makes Intuition's knowledge graph globally referenceable and interoperable</li>
</ul>

<div className="uniform-card">
<h3 className="uniform-card-title">3. Incentivize Consensus on Standards and Structures</h3>
<ul style={{ margin: 0, paddingLeft: '1.2rem', fontSize: '0.95rem', lineHeight: '1.6' }}>
<li>Communities can propose schemas and data formats (e.g., predicates like <code>foundedBy</code>, <code>headquarteredIn</code>)</li>
<li>Rewards flow toward attestations that align with commonly adopted standards</li>
<li>Over time, the protocol nudges participants into consensus-driven data structures, so the web of knowledge doesn't just grow — it grows in a structured, interoperable way</li>
</ul>

## $TRUST Token

The native token $TRUST enables users to:
- Accumulate stake in the information you believe in
- Retain true ownership of what you create
- Earn as that data gains traction and value across the network

## Example Flow: How the Incentives Work

<div style={{ backgroundColor: 'var(--ifm-color-emphasis-50)', padding: '1.5rem', borderRadius: '8px', margin: '1.5rem 0', border: '1px solid var(--ifm-color-emphasis-300)' }}>

### 1. Expression
**Alice creates a new Atom: a DID for Tesla, Inc.**
- She publishes an attestation: `[Tesla] – [foundedBy] – [Elon Musk]`, staking $TRUST behind it
- Because she was first, she captures the early-mover rewards

### 2. Convergence
**Bob considers creating his own identifier for Tesla**
- But Alice's Atom already has traction, with value flowing into its bonding curve
- The economics reward Bob for using the existing canonical DID instead of fragmenting the graph

### 3. Consensus on Standards
**Carol proposes that `foundedBy` and `headquarteredIn` should be standard predicates for corporate entities**
- The network's incentive structure rewards attestations that align with these schemas
- As more users adopt them, `foundedBy` becomes a consensus-backed data standard

### 4. Ongoing Rewards
**As developers and AI agents query Tesla-related data, fees flow back to the identifiers and attestations that power those queries**
- Alice, Bob, and Carol all share in the economic upside of having built durable, widely used pieces of the graph

## Reward Dynamics

To maximize engagement and data quality, the system favors contributions that are:
