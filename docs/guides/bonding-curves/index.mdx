# Bonding Curves

Bonding curves define how the price of an asset changes based on supply and demand. In the Intuition Protocol, they allow vaults to dynamically price semantic assets like atoms and triples.

A bonding curve is a pricing mechanism — it determines how much ETH a user pays (or gets back) when depositing to or redeeming from a vault. This lets projects:

- **Incentivize early participation** with cheaper entry prices.
- **Control supply** with rising costs as more tokens are minted.
- **Align economics** with data value or staking behavior.

Intuition uses bonding curves in the EthMultiVault system to handle deposits and redemptions for both atoms (individual semantic claims) and triples (subject–predicate–object sets).


##  Real-World Use Cases

| Use Case | How Bonding Curves Help |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **Data Markets** | Pay to mint assertions on-chain; rising cost controls spam. |
| **Staking Derivatives** | Price increases with TVL, modeling yield or scarcity. |
| **Protocol Governance** | Curves can align incentives for governance participation. |
| **Custom Economies** | Plug in your own math logic via custom curves. |

##  Design Philosophy

Bonding curves in Intuition Protocol are modular by design:

- **Registry-based routing**: Vaults remain clean and upgrade-safe.
- **Symmetrical math API**: All curves implement the same interface.
- **Upgradeable curves**: Developers can ship custom curves anytime — no need to upgrade the vault.

In upcoming versions (V2), we'll simplify things even further by removing suffixes like `depositAtomCurve`, replacing them with a unified API keyed by `curveId`.


## How Bonding Curves Fit into the Protocol

Here's the basic architecture:

```
User / dApp
   │
   ▼
EthMultiVault
   ├─ Standard paths (Linear math inline)
   └─ Curve-specific paths
        │
        ▼
BondingCurveRegistry ──→ BaseCurve (Linear, OffsetProgressive, custom...)
```

- **EthMultiVault** handles deposits/redemptions.
- If a non-linear curve is specified, it routes to the **BondingCurveRegistry**.
- The registry proxies math to the appropriate curve contract using a `curveId`.

##  Curve Types

### Linear Curve 
#### (curveId = 1)

A simple, pro-rata pricing model where every deposit gets the same rate:

```solidity
price = totalAssets / totalShares;
```

This is the default math embedded directly into EthMultiVault, but we include a separate LinearCurve contract for compatibility and future flexibility.
:::tip
 Great for simple, predictable token issuance.
:::
### Offset Progressive Curve 
#### (curveId = 4)

A more dynamic curve where price increases linearly based on total supply:

```math
P(s) = m ∗ (s + offset)
```

Mint cost is the area under the curve, meaning early deposits are cheaper:

```math
Cost = (m/2) ∗ [(s₂ + offset)² − (s₁ + offset)²]
```

Redemption returns are also curve-aware:

```math
Return = (m/2) ∗ [2 ∗ (s + offset) ∗ r − r²]
```

Where:
```math
- **s** = current shares
- **r** = shares being redeemed
```
:::tip 
Ideal for data markets and staking derivatives** — you can reward early supporters and make each additional share more expensive.

##  Code Examples

###  Deposit Using a Curve

Deposit ETH into a vault with the Offset Progressive curve:

```solidity
EthMultiVault.depositAtomCurve{value: amountETH}(
    msg.sender,   // receiver of shares
    atomId,       // which atom to deposit into
    4             // curveId for OffsetProgressive
);
```

###  Preview Deposit in Frontend

Estimate how many shares a user would get before committing ETH:

```cpp
uint256 shares = vault.previewDepositCurve(amountETH, atomId, 4);
```

You can also check the current price:

```cpp
uint256 price = registry.currentPrice(totalShares, 4);
```

###  Register a New Curve (Admin Only)

If you've written your own curve, you can add it like this:

```cpp
uint256 curveId = registry.addBondingCurve(address(myCustomCurve));
vault.setBondingCurveConfig(address(registry), curveId); // optional
```

You only need to implement the BaseCurve interface to plug in.


## Share Display and User Experience

### Understanding Share Values

Intuition displays share values in a user-friendly format to make ownership easier to understand. The Portal frontend shows one "Share" as 1/100,000th of the 1 ETH-equivalent raw value recorded in smart contracts.

**Why this matters:**
- **Simpler numbers**: Users see whole numbers instead of lengthy decimals
- **Familiar concept**: Similar to how Bitcoin (Satoshis) and Ethereum (Wei) work
- **Clear ownership**: Easier to understand your position size

**Example:**
- Smart contract: 1,000,000 raw units
- Portal display: 10 shares
- Each share = 100,000 raw units

### No Impact on Positions
:::info
**Important**: This is purely a display change. Your actual positions and the underlying smart contracts remain unchanged.
:::
##  Summary

- Bonding curves are a flexible pricing tool for atoms and triples.
- Intuition supports multiple curve types, each with their own pricing logic.
- You can preview, extend, or customize bonding behavior with minimal friction.
- The system is secure, upgrade-safe, and open to new economic designs.
- Share display is optimized for user experience while preserving contract integrity.
