# Network Health

The Intuition Network Health page provides real-time monitoring of all network services, infrastructure health, and uptime statistics. Powered by Better Stack, this monitoring system ensures transparency and helps developers track service availability.

## Quick Access

View the current network status at: [https://testnet.uptime.intuition.systems/](https://testnet.uptime.intuition.systems/)

## Overview

The network health monitoring tracks critical components of the Intuition infrastructure:

- Rollup RPC endpoints
- Bridge services
- Explorer availability
- Network health metrics
- Service dependencies

## Current Status

### **All Services Online**
When all systems are operational, you'll see:
- Green status indicators across all services
- 100% uptime metrics
- Normal response times
- No active incidents

### **Service Monitoring**
The status page tracks:
- **Rollup RPC Healthcheck**: Core network connectivity
- **Bridge Service**: Cross-chain transfer functionality
- **Explorer Service**: Blockchain exploration tools
- **Hub Service**: Developer dashboard availability

## Service Details

### **Rollup RPC Healthcheck**
- **Purpose**: Monitors core network RPC endpoints
- **Metrics**: Response time, availability, error rates
- **Impact**: Affects all network interactions and transactions
- **Status**: Real-time uptime percentage displayed

### **Network Health Indicators**
Key metrics monitored include:
- Block production consistency
- Transaction processing speeds
- Gas price stability
- Network congestion levels

## Uptime Statistics

### **Historical Data**
- 24-hour uptime percentages
- 7-day availability metrics
- 30-day reliability statistics
- Incident history and resolution times

### **Performance Metrics**
- Average response times
- Peak performance periods
- Service degradation alerts
- Recovery time statistics

## Incident Management

### **Incident Reporting**
When issues occur, the status page provides:
- Real-time incident updates
- Estimated resolution times
- Impact assessment
- Progress updates during resolution

### **Incident Types**
Common incident categories:
- **Service Outages**: Complete service unavailability
- **Performance Degradation**: Slower than normal response times
- **Partial Outages**: Some features affected
- **Maintenance Windows**: Planned service interruptions

## Notifications and Alerts

### **Subscribe to Updates**
Stay informed about service status:
1. Visit the status page
2. Click "Subscribe to status updates"
3. Choose notification preferences:
   - Email notifications
   - SMS alerts (if available)
   - RSS feeds
   - Webhook integrations

### **Alert Types**
- **Incident Notifications**: Immediate alerts for new issues
- **Resolution Updates**: Notifications when issues are resolved
- **Maintenance Announcements**: Advance notice of planned work
- **Performance Alerts**: Warnings about service degradation

## Developer Integration

### **Status API**
Integrate status information into your applications:
- JSON API for current status
- Historical uptime data
- Incident information
- Webhook notifications for status changes

### **Monitoring Best Practices**
For developers building on Intuition:
- Check status before reporting issues
- Implement retry logic for temporary outages
- Monitor your own application metrics
- Subscribe to status notifications

## Service Dependencies

### **Critical Services**
Understanding service relationships:
- **Hub** depends on RPC health
- **Bridge functionality** requires both networks
- **Explorer** needs RPC and database services
- **API endpoints** rely on core infrastructure

### **Cascading Effects**
When core services experience issues:
- Dependent services may show degraded performance
- Some features may be temporarily unavailable
- Transactions may experience delays
- Explorer data may lag behind

## Maintenance Windows

### **Planned Maintenance**
- Advance notice provided on status page
- Maintenance windows scheduled during low-usage periods
- Expected duration and impact communicated
- Progress updates during maintenance

### **Emergency Maintenance**
- Immediate notifications for critical issues
- Real-time progress updates
- Post-maintenance service verification
- Incident post-mortems when applicable

## Historical Performance

### **Reliability Metrics**
Track long-term network reliability:
- Monthly uptime statistics
- Incident frequency and duration
- Performance trend analysis
- Service improvement tracking

### **Network Growth**
Monitor network adoption and usage:
- Transaction volume trends
- Active developer metrics
- Service utilization patterns
- Performance under load

## Using Status Information

### **Before Developing**
- Check current service status
- Review recent incident history
- Verify all dependencies are operational
- Subscribe to notifications

### **During Development**
- Monitor status if experiencing issues
- Correlate application problems with service status
- Use status API for application health checks
- Report unrelated issues to support

### **Incident Response**
When services are affected:
1. Check status page for known issues
2. Review incident updates and ETAs
3. Implement fallback strategies if needed
4. Wait for resolution before escalating
