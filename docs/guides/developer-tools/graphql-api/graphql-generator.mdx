# GraphQL Generator

The Intuition GraphQL package can be used as a GraphQL generator for your custom queries. It provides a type-safe interface for interacting with the Intuition API. It serves as the core data fetching layer, offering generated types and React Query hooks for seamless integration with the semantic knowledge graph.

## Key Features

- Type-safe GraphQL operations leveraging code gen
- React Query hooks for data fetching
- Reusable GraphQL fragments
- Easy to customize to your specific needs
- Supports real-time updates from the Intuition GraphQL API through GraphQL subscriptions


## Installation

The source code for the GraphQL generator is available on GitHub: [intuition-ts/packages/graphql](https://github.com/0xIntuition/intuition-ts/tree/main/packages/graphql)
Which you can copy and paste into your own project to use as a GraphQL generator.



## Schema Management

The package uses a local-first approach for schema management:

- Local `schema.graphql` as source of truth
- Remote schema fallback for resilience
- Automatic schema generation during builds
- Version controlled schema for team consistency



## Package Structure

```bash
graphql/
├── src/
│ ├── client.ts # Client configuration
│ ├── fragments/ # Reusable fragments
│ ├── queries/ # GraphQL queries
│ ├── mutations/ # GraphQL mutations
│ └── generated/ # Generated types
├── schema.graphql # Schema definition
└── codegen.ts # Codegen config
```

Note that there is no subscriptions folder in this package, but because the GraphQL API supports subscriptions for real-time updates, you can easily add them to the generator.



## Package Approach

1. **Schema Updates**
    - Uses the local schema committed in the repository as the source for codegen and uses the remote URL as a fallback
2. **Query Organization**
    - Uses fragments for reusable fields
    - Includes use-case specific queries as well as general purpose queries
3. **Type Safety**
    - Leverages generated types from our schema
    - Generates React Query hooks as well as document queries that can be used in a server context (or with another client such as Apollo)
4. **Client Configuration**
    - Default client configuration can be overridden in each consumer app
    - Supports environment-specific API URLs

## Craft your own custom queries

We recommend using a GraphQL explorer to browse the Intuition GraphQL API schema and to draft and test your queries, mutations, and subscriptions before implementing them in code.
You can use [Apollo Explorer](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/explorer) for this and enter the Intuition testnet GraphQL API URL: `https://testnet.intuition.sh/v1/graphql`


## Development Workflow

1. **Code Generation**
    - `pnpm codegen:build # Generate types`
    - `pnpm codegen:watch # Watch mode for development`
2. **Building**
    - `pnpm build # Full build with codegen`
    - `pnpm dev # Development mode with watch`
3. **Testing**
    - `pnpm test`


## Use your custom React Query hooks

Once you have run the codegen, you can use your custom React Query Hooks in your own components.

```tsx
import { useCustomTriplesQuery } from 'graphql/generated/hooks'

function MyComponent() {
  // Query triples based on your custom needs
  const { data: triples, isLoading: triplesLoading } = useCustomTriplesQuery({
    query: 'query CustomQuery { ... }'
  })

  return (
    <div>


      <h2>Triples ({triples?.triples?.length || 0})</h2>
      {triples?.triples?.map(triple => (
        <div key={triple.id}>
          {triple.subject.uri} - {triple.predicate.uri} - {triple.object.uri}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```
