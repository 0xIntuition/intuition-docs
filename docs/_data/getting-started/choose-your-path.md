# Choose Your Path

Not sure where to start? Pick the path that matches your goal.

## I Want to...

### Build a Frontend App (Most Common)

**Use the SDK** - High-level TypeScript SDK with React hooks.

- Best for: Web apps, dashboards, social platforms
- Abstracts complexity
- React integration ready
- **Start here:** [SDK Quick Start](/docs/intuition-sdk/quick-start)

### Query Data Only (No Writes)

**Use GraphQL API** - Read-only queries for the knowledge graph.

- Best for: Analytics, dashboards, data visualization
- No wallet needed for reads
- Powerful filtering and aggregation
- **Start here:** [GraphQL Setup](/docs/graphql-api/getting-started/client-setup)

### Build Smart Contract Integration

**Use Protocol Package** - Low-level contract interactions.

- Best for: Other smart contracts, custom logic, gas optimization
- Direct contract calls
- Full control
- **Start here:** [Protocol Configuration](/docs/protocol/getting-started/configuration)

### Understand the System First

**Read Concepts** - Learn how Intuition works.

- Atoms, Triples, Signals
- Economics and incentives
- Architecture
- **Start here:** [Primitives Overview](/docs/intuition-concepts/primitives)

### See Complete Examples

**Follow Tutorials** - Build real applications step-by-step.

- Reputation system
- Curated lists
- Social attestations
- **Start here:** [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials/overview)
