# Intuition SDK Overview

The `@0xintuition/sdk` is your all-in-one toolkit for building with the Intuition Protocol. It helps you interact with both the on-chain and off-chain components of the protocol using a clean, typed TypeScript interface.

You can use it to:

- 🧱 **Create semantic data** (atoms & triples)
- 🪙 **Deposit ETH into vaults** using dynamic bonding curves
- 🔍 **Query protocol state** via GraphQL
- ⚙️ **Integrate GraphQL + smart contracts** together with minimal boilerplate

Whether you're building a full dApp, a CLI tool, or just scripting some protocol interactions — this SDK will save you time and prevent bugs.

##  Installation

Install via your favorite package manager:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm" default>

```bash
pnpm add @0xintuition/sdk
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
npm install @0xintuition/sdk
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="bun" label="bun">

```bash
bun add @0xintuition/sdk
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You'll also need:

- A Web3 provider (like MetaMask or WalletConnect)
- A GraphQL token (only if you want to use protected queries or mutations)
##  SDK Features & Benefits

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| 🔁 **Unified API** | Combines GraphQL + smart contract flows in one toolkit |
| 🧩 **Typed interface** | Safer development with full IntelliSense + type safety |
| ⚙️ **Modular** | Use off-chain, on-chain, or both — your choice |
| ✨ **Fast to start** | Get up and running in just a few lines | 
## ⚡ Quick Start

Here's how to initialize the SDK in one step:

```typescript
import { setup } from '@0xintuition/sdk';

const { client, protocol } = await setup({
  token: YOUR_GRAPHQL_TOKEN,
  web3Provider: window.ethereum,
  network: 'mainnet',
});
```

This gives you:

- **client**: for GraphQL-based reads and writes (e.g. querying vaults or creating atoms)
- **protocol**: for smart contract calls (e.g. deposits, redemptions)

## 🧠 What is an Atom?

Think of an atom as a semantic unit of information — like a digital claim or identity tag. Atoms can be:

- Minted (off-chain + on-chain)
- Grouped into triples (subject–predicate–object)
- Deposited into, just like a vault

## 🔧 Core Features

### 🧬 Creating an Atom

Use this when you want to define a new semantic entity.

```typescript
const atom = await client.createAtom({
  owner: '0xYourWallet',
  label: 'test-atom-1',
  metadata: {
    name: 'My Atom',
    description: 'A semantic unit for testing',
  },
});
```

📘 This creates an off-chain representation. It can later be linked with vaults or used in triples.

### 🔗 Creating a Triple (S–P–O)

Triples allow you to relate atoms together like:

*Alice → knows → Bob*

```typescript
await client.createTriple({
  subject: atomIdAlice,
  predicate: atomIdKnows,
  object: atomIdBob,
  curveId: 4, // Optional: attach a bonding curve
});
```

You can use bonding curves to influence the economics of creating or modifying semantic relationships.

### 📈 Previewing a Deposit (Off-chain)

Want to know how many shares a user would receive before they actually send ETH?

```typescript
const preview = await client.previewDeposit({
  atomId: '123',
  amountWei: '1000000000000000000', // 1 ETH
  curveId: 4,
});

console.log(preview.shares); // e.g. 0.82 shares
```

Great for frontend apps that want to show "you'll receive X shares for Y ETH" in real time.

### 💸 Making a Deposit (On-chain)

Once the user confirms, you can submit the transaction:

```typescript
const tx = await protocol.vaults.depositAtomCurve('123', '1000000000000000000', 4);
await tx.wait();
```

This deposits ETH into the atom vault, mints vault shares for the user, and enforces any curve logic associated.



## 💻 Real Example: React Component

Here's a self-contained UI snippet that previews and executes a deposit:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { setup } from '@0xintuition/sdk';

function DepositComponent({ atomId }) {
  const [shares, setShares] = React.useState(null);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      const { client } = await setup({ 
        token: TOKEN, 
        web3Provider: window.ethereum, 
        network: 'mainnet' 
      });
      const preview = await client.previewDeposit({ 
        atomId, 
        amountWei: '1000000000000000000', 
        curveId: 4 
      });
      setShares(preview.shares);
    })();
  }, [atomId]);

  const handleDeposit = async () => {
    const { protocol } = await setup({ 
      token: TOKEN, 
      web3Provider: window.ethereum, 
      network: 'mainnet' 
    });
    const tx = await protocol.vaults.depositAtomCurve(atomId, '1000000000000000000', 4);
    await tx.wait();
    alert('✅ Deposit confirmed');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Estimated Shares: {shares}</p>
      <button onClick={handleDeposit}>Deposit 1 ETH</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 🛠️ Advanced Examples

### Get Vault Address for Atom

```typescript
const vaultAddress = protocol.vaults.getAtomVault(atomId);
```

### Read Curve Configuration

Useful if you're rendering UI based on curve behavior:

```typescript
const curve = await protocol.curves.getCurveConfig(4);
```

### Register a Custom Curve (Admin Only)

Want to test your own economic model?

```typescript
const curveId = await protocol.curves.registerCustomCurve('0xYourCurveContractAddress');
```
