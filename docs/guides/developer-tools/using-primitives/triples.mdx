# Triples

Triples are structured data units that connect three atoms together in a subject-predicate-object relationship. They form the foundation for creating semantic networks and knowledge graphs within the Intuition system.

## What are Triples?

A triple consists of three atoms connected in a specific relationship:

- **Subject**: The entity being described
- **Predicate**: The relationship or property
- **Object**: The value or target of the relationship

## Triple Structure

```
Subject → Predicate → Object
```

For example:
- `User123` → `likes` → `Post456`
- `Article789` → `hasTag` → `Technology`
- `CompanyABC` → `locatedIn` → `San Francisco`

## Creating Triples

### Basic Triple Creation
Triples are created by connecting three existing atoms with a specific relationship.

### Validating Triples
Each triple must be validated to ensure:
- All three atoms exist
- The relationship is meaningful
- The triple follows system constraints

## Using Triples

### Building Knowledge Graphs
Triples can be connected to form complex knowledge graphs that represent relationships between entities.

### Querying Relationships
Triples enable powerful queries to find connections and patterns in the data.

### Semantic Search
Triples provide the foundation for semantic search capabilities across the network.

## Triple Types

### Standard Triples
Basic subject-predicate-object relationships.

### Qualified Triples
Triples with additional metadata or qualifications.

### Temporal Triples
Triples that include time-based information.

## Best Practices

1. **Meaningful Relationships**: Ensure predicates represent meaningful connections
2. **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions for predicates
3. **Validation**: Always validate triples before publishing
4. **Reusability**: Design triples to be reusable across different contexts

## Examples

```javascript
// Creating a triple
const triple = {
  subject: "user-123",
  predicate: "likes",
  object: "post-456",
  metadata: {
    createdAt: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    confidence: 0.95
  }
}
```
