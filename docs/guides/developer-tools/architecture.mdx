# Architecture

This section provides a comprehensive overview of Intuition's system architecture, including its core components, design principles, and how different parts of the system interact with each other.

## System Overview

Intuition is built on a decentralized architecture that enables trustful interactions and economic incentives. The system consists of several key components:

### Core Components

- **Smart Contracts**: The backbone of the system, handling trust bonds, bonding curves, and economic mechanisms
- **GraphQL API**: Provides a unified interface for querying and interacting with the system
- **SDKs**: Client libraries that simplify integration with the Intuition protocol
- **Network Layer**: Handles communication and data synchronization across the network

### Design Principles

1. **Decentralization**: No single point of failure or control
2. **Economic Incentives**: Built-in mechanisms that align user behavior with system goals
3. **Trustful Interactions**: Cryptographic guarantees for secure and verifiable interactions
4. **Composability**: Modular design that allows for easy extension and customization

## Architecture Layers

### Layer 1: Protocol Layer
The foundational layer that defines the core primitives and economic mechanisms.

### Layer 2: Network Layer
Handles data distribution, synchronization, and network coordination.

### Layer 3: Application Layer
Provides APIs, SDKs, and tools for building applications on top of Intuition.

## Integration Points

Understanding how these layers interact is crucial for building effective applications on Intuition. Each layer provides specific capabilities while maintaining the system's core principles of decentralization and economic incentives.
