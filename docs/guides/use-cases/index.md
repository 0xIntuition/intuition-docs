![Use Cases](/img/use-cases.png)

This article outlines use cases that take advantage of Intuition's unique knowledge graph and claim infrastructure. There are many more ways to use Intuition (and we would love to see what you come up with!), but here are some ideas to get you started.

## List Curation & Ranking Systems

Intuition can be used to create permissionless, community-curated ranked lists and registries. Anyone can create a list that groups together identities with a common claim about them (such as sharing a common tag, use case, purpose, etc). The list can then be curated by the original uploader and anyone else on the platform by adding additional identities or supporting/opposing each item with a financial stake to change it’s ranking. Users can filter and sort results from that list to find what matters to them. They can see the global list of everything added by anyone, just their own contributions, or items vetted by people they follow or trust.

- Web3 Ecosystem: Curate trusted smart contracts, addresses, DeFi protocols, memecoins, NFT communities, and Web3 games based on reputation formed by on-chain metadata and user attestations
- AI resources: Find and orchestrate trusted AI agents based on rich metadata and on-chain reputation, know the best models based on community feedback, and train AI with validated data sources and efficiently structured knowledge
- Entertainment and media: Rank top and emerging music, movies, news sources, podcasts, sports teams, and more based on staked TRUST “support” positions and attestations from users you follow who share your taste
- Data and Research: Find the most reliable data sources and reports based on peer review attestations and supporting positions from trusted colleagues
- Consumer Products: Find and help rank top-rated consumer products, applications, and more
- Product improvements: Have your community share their top feature requests and bugs to fix so you can prioritize which to tackle first
- Travel: Uncover popular travel destinations through collective recommendations

## Verification and Fraud Protection

Intuition helps trusted experts flag potentially dangerous websites, smart contracts, products, and more using structure claims to help everyday consumers stay safe.

- Decentralized Information Validation: Engage a distributed community to verify and endorse the accuracy and authenticity of any data (e.g. smart contracts, information, packaged good supply chains, images, news, etc)
- Fraud Detection and Alerts: Engage a worldwide team of incentivized auditors and moderators to report potentially dangerous or fraudulent activities, including crypto scams and malicious AI agents, and alert users when they are about to engage with a threat on the Web.
- Curator & Auditor Recognition: Rank individuals—whether they're auditing contracts or curating news—based on their proficiency, accuracy, and community credibility. This ensures a transparent trajectory in both contract auditing and news curation.

## Community-Owned Social Platforms

Intuition creates on-chain decentralized identities for people and concepts, and allows any account to make verifiable claims about themselves and others. These primitives can form the basis of powerful social networks, driven by publicly visible and searchable graphs of verified connections and attestations.

- Portable On-Chain Identity: Each person on the social network gets a self-sovereign identity, allowing them to own their verifiable data (claims by and about them) and make it portable to any other system, instead of being locked into keeping their data with a single platform.
- Advanced Signaling and Verification: Transform traditional up-vote/down-vote and/or likes/dislikes into attestations, offering richer feedback and community insights for debates, conversations, and more.
- Member Credibility: Promote trust between distributed community members by highlighting verifiable achievements and certifications, providing community reputation attestations and scores, and more.

## Incentivized Ratings and Referrals

Using claims, Intuition can provide on-chain ratings and referrals for media, software, travel destinations, and more. Tastemakers can earn money by being early to place support or oppose financial positions to rate promising items they know their communities will find relevant, capturing fees when subsequent reviewers follow suite.

- Attestation-Backed Ratings: Transition from simplistic star ratings to attestations, ensuring each review reflects a more comprehensive and verified experience
- Transparent Reviewer Profiles: Utilize attestations to validate reviewer authenticity, experience, and expertise, giving more weight to trusted community members' feedback
- Community-Driven Trustworthiness: Allow community members to vouch for or against reviews, enhancing the credibility of feedback and reducing the impact of fraudulent reviews.
- Simple Referrals: Businesses can request referrals for their offerings from tastemakers, rewarding those tastemakers financially when others catch on, place their own support position, and make the offering go viral.
- Review Aggregation & Insights: Harness the power of structured attestation data to generate summary insights from reviews, helping customers make informed decisions faster and helping businesses understand their strengths and areas of improvement.

## Q&A Platforms

Question and answer platforms can yield results from structured knowledge sharing, support/oppose positions on claims, and in-depth identity and reputation for each participant.

- Claiming Expertise: Users self-attest areas of knowledge, setting the stage for their contributions and peer review.
- Community Attestations: Peer validation of answers allows for real-time quality & sentiment checks.
- Verification: Answer validation is reinforced by the wisdom of the crowd, balancing answer credibility.
- Reputation Building: Continuous positive attestations lead to a trustworthy reputation score, distinguishing genuine experts from the crowd.

## Reputation scores

Intuition facilitates both financial and social signals about identities and claims to help people construct their own sense of reputation for things they encounter. From these primitives, third-party developers can construct reputation scores that make this contextual trust easy to interpret.

- Trustworthiness Index: Evaluate entities based on their past track record and overarching  conduct within different contexts.
- Platform Credibility: Prioritize platforms known for specific things - such as undercollateralized lending - spotlighting those with a track record for precise credit evaluations.
- Credit Scoring: Harness the transparency of blockchain for decentralized credit scores, presenting a holistic and immutable snapshot of an individual's or entity's lending history.
- Lending Confidence: Empower lenders to confidently engage in undercollateralized loans, underpinned by clear and transparent Web3 credit reputation metrics.

## Oracles

Decentralized applications can use on-chain claims made by trusted accounts managed by people or secure bots (or a combination of these entities and their collective opinions) in Intuition to trigger other on-chain events.

- Consensus Result Extraction: Derive a data beacon or collective answer based on the weight and credibility of aggregated attestations, and use it to provide triggers for smart contract logic.
- Censorship Resistance: Define trust so that any entity that fits the criteria can support dApps with reliable information to guide actions, free of censorship.

## Business, Employment & Consulting Platforms

Companies and consultancies, as well as the people who work for them, can use decentralized identifiers and claims made by those that have done business with them to determine whether their potential collaborators are trustworthy and fit for the task at hand.

- Professional Credibility: Evaluate the authenticity of individuals, organizations, and services based on proven credentials.
- Expertise Showcase: Verify the skills, experiences, and specializations of consultants to match with appropriate projects or clients.
- Credential-Based Products: Incorporate platforms enhanced with reputation systems to assess credibility and reliability in the consulting domain.
- Collaborative Experiences: Attest to the quality and outcome of consulting projects and share insights from fruitful partnerships.
- Consultation Metrics: Utilize advanced tools and analytics to measure the impact and effectiveness of consulting services offered.
- Transparent Feedback Loop: Allow clients to provide feedback on consulting services, ensuring continual improvement and trust-building in the community.

## Verified Voting

Verified community members can create proposals as identities, then allow other community members to make claims about those proposals with evidence, support or oppose the proposals, or rank the proposals in a list to signal what the community should handle next.

- Identity Assurance: Implement mechanisms to ensure that each vote is tied to a verified identity, eliminating duplicate votes and ensuring transparency.
- Hackathon Judging: Accurately capture and reflect community votes to determine hackathon winners and associated projects, fostering a fair competitive environment.
- DAO Proposal Voting: Promote permissionless executions grounded in community consensus and sentiment, enabling decentralized decisions with integrity.
- Vote Attestation: Allow members to vouch for or challenge voting results, adding an additional layer of community-backed verification to the process.
- Reputation-Based Voting Power: Adjust the weight of votes based on the track record and credibility of members, ensuring experienced voices have a significant say.

## Trading Knowledge

Intuition can help surface knowledgable market voices, and even gather intelligence on bullish opportunities through curated lists of assets with support or oppose positions to signal their attractiveness as an investment.

- Evaluate and ascertain the credibility of traders or investors based on historical decisions, profitability, and ethical behavior.
- Assess and rank trading/investment platforms using community-driven reviews, transaction success rates, and security protocols.
- Determine the trustworthiness of diverse investment assets through community ratings, feedback, and historical performance benchmarks.

## Verifiable Predictions, Claims & Forecasting

Intuition can help people signal what they believe will happen next or be advantageous in the future, making early verifiable claims about events or opportunities and putting financial positions behind them to communicate their certainty. These claims and commitments can be used by others who need to decide what’s most likely to happen in the future, like a perpetual, non-resolving prediction market.

- Know Your Futurist: Elevate trusted voices whose foresight consistently aligns with events and who posses domain knowledge, emphasizing their expertise within the community.
- Provable Track Records: Assess past predictions in the form of claims from thought leaders in Intuition, including any financial stake they placed on the prediction, to determine their likelihood of correctly predicting future events.
