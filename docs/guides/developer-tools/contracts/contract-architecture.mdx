# Contract Architecture

This section provides a comprehensive overview of Intuition's smart contract architecture, including the core components, design patterns, and how different contracts interact with each other.

## System Overview

Intuition's smart contract system is built on a modular architecture that enables trustful interactions and economic incentives. The system consists of several key components:

### Core Components

- **Trust Bonding Contracts**: Handle the creation and management of trust bonds
- **Bonding Curve Contracts**: Manage dynamic pricing mechanisms
- **Multi-Vault Contracts**: Handle asset storage and management
- **Registry Contracts**: Maintain system-wide registries and mappings
- **Governance Contracts**: Handle decentralized governance mechanisms

### Design Principles

1. **Modularity**: Each contract has a specific responsibility and can be upgraded independently
2. **Security**: Extensive security measures and audit processes
3. **Gas Efficiency**: Optimized for cost-effective operations
4. **Upgradability**: Support for contract upgrades while maintaining state
5. **Interoperability**: Contracts can interact seamlessly with each other

## Contract Layers

### Layer 1: Core Contracts
The foundational layer that defines the basic primitives and economic mechanisms.

### Layer 2: Management Contracts
Contracts that manage the lifecycle and interactions of core contracts.

### Layer 3: Integration Contracts
Contracts that provide interfaces for external systems and applications.

## Core Contract Types

### Trust Bonding Contracts

Trust bonding contracts are the foundation of the Intuition system, enabling users to create and manage trust relationships.

**Key Features:**
- Trust bond creation and management
- Bonding curve integration
- Automated pricing mechanisms
- Liquidity provision

**Example Contract:**

```solidity
contract TrustBonding {
    struct Bond {
        address creator;
        address beneficiary;
        uint256 amount;
        uint256 duration;
        bool active;
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => Bond) public bonds;
    uint256 public bondCounter;
    
    function createBond(
        address _beneficiary,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _duration
    ) external returns (uint256) {
        // Bond creation logic
    }
    
    function activateBond(uint256 _bondId) external {
        // Bond activation logic
    }
}
```

### Bonding Curve Contracts

Bonding curve contracts implement the mathematical functions that determine asset pricing based on supply.

**Key Features:**
- Dynamic pricing algorithms
- Automated market making
- Liquidity provision
- Price discovery mechanisms

**Example Contract:**

```solidity
contract BondingCurve {
    uint256 public basePrice;
    uint256 public slope;
    uint256 public supply;
    
    function calculatePrice(uint256 _supply) public view returns (uint256) {
        return basePrice + (_supply * slope);
    }
    
    function buy(uint256 _amount) external payable {
        uint256 currentPrice = calculatePrice(supply);
        uint256 newSupply = supply + _amount;
        uint256 newPrice = calculatePrice(newSupply);
        uint256 cost = (currentPrice + newPrice) / 2 * _amount;
        
        require(msg.value >= cost, "Insufficient payment");
        
        supply = newSupply;
        // Transfer tokens to buyer
    }
}
```

### Multi-Vault Contracts

Multi-vault contracts handle the storage and management of assets across different vaults.

**Key Features:**
- Asset storage and retrieval
- Vault management
- Cross-vault operations
- Security mechanisms

**Example Contract:**

```solidity
contract MultiVault {
    struct Vault {
        address owner;
        uint256 balance;
        bool active;
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => Vault) public vaults;
    uint256 public vaultCounter;
    
    function createVault() external returns (uint256) {
        uint256 vaultId = vaultCounter++;
        vaults[vaultId] = Vault({
            owner: msg.sender,
            balance: 0,
            active: true
        });
        return vaultId;
    }
    
    function deposit(uint256 _vaultId) external payable {
        require(vaults[_vaultId].active, "Vault not active");
        vaults[_vaultId].balance += msg.value;
    }
}
```

## Contract Interactions

### Trust Bond Creation Flow

1. **User Interaction**: User calls the trust bonding contract
2. **Validation**: Contract validates parameters and user permissions
3. **Bonding Curve Integration**: Price is calculated using bonding curve
4. **Multi-Vault Integration**: Assets are stored in appropriate vaults
5. **Event Emission**: Events are emitted for off-chain processing

### Bonding Curve Integration

1. **Price Calculation**: Current price is calculated based on supply
2. **Payment Processing**: User payment is processed
3. **Supply Update**: Supply is updated according to purchase amount
4. **Token Distribution**: Tokens are distributed to the buyer
5. **Liquidity Provision**: Liquidity is automatically provided

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

- **Role-based Access**: Different roles have different permissions
- **Multi-signature Support**: Critical operations require multiple signatures
- **Timelock Mechanisms**: Delayed execution for governance actions
- **Emergency Pause**: Ability to pause contracts in emergencies

### Audit and Testing

- **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive unit and integration tests
- **Security Audits**: Regular third-party security audits
- **Formal Verification**: Mathematical verification of critical functions
- **Bug Bounty Programs**: Incentives for finding security issues

## Upgrade Mechanisms

### Proxy Pattern

Contracts use the proxy pattern to enable upgrades while maintaining state:

```solidity
contract Proxy {
    address public implementation;
    address public admin;
    
    modifier onlyAdmin() {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Not authorized");
        _;
    }
    
    function upgrade(address _newImplementation) external onlyAdmin {
        implementation = _newImplementation;
    }
    
    fallback() external {
        address _impl = implementation;
        assembly {
            calldatacopy(0, 0, calldatasize())
            let result := delegatecall(gas(), _impl, 0, calldatasize(), 0, 0)
            returndatacopy(0, 0, returndatasize())
            switch result
            case 0 { revert(0, returndatasize()) }
            default { return(0, returndatasize()) }
        }
    }
}
```

### Upgrade Process

1. **Development**: New implementation is developed and tested
2. **Audit**: Implementation undergoes security audit
3. **Governance**: Upgrade is proposed and voted on
4. **Deployment**: New implementation is deployed
5. **Upgrade**: Proxy is updated to point to new implementation

## Gas Optimization

### Efficient Storage

- **Packed Structs**: Optimize storage by packing related data
- **Storage Patterns**: Use efficient storage patterns
- **Batch Operations**: Group operations to reduce gas costs

### Computation Optimization

- **Algorithm Efficiency**: Use efficient algorithms
- **Loop Optimization**: Minimize loop iterations
- **External Calls**: Optimize external contract calls

## Best Practices

1. **Modular Design**: Keep contracts focused and modular
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test all edge cases and scenarios
3. **Security First**: Prioritize security over optimization
4. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation
5. **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring and alerting systems
