# Key Terms

This page defines the essential terminology used throughout the Intuition ecosystem. Understanding these terms will help you navigate the documentation and build effectively with Intuition.

## Core Concepts

### Atoms
Atoms are the fundamental units of data in the Intuition ecosystem. They represent individual pieces of information that can be referenced, traded, and combined to create more complex data structures.

### Triples
Triples are structured data units that connect atoms through relationships. Each triple consists of a subject, predicate, and object, forming the building blocks for semantic data representation.

### Signals
Signals are dynamic data streams that represent real-time information or events. They can be subscribed to and processed to create responsive applications.

### Bonding Curves
Bonding curves are mathematical functions that determine the price of atoms based on their supply. They enable automated market making and price discovery for data assets.

## Network Components

### Attestors
Attestors are network participants who validate and verify the authenticity of data. They play a crucial role in maintaining data integrity and trust within the ecosystem.

### Atom Wardens
Atom wardens are responsible for managing and curating specific atoms. They ensure data quality and relevance within their domain of expertise.

### Trust Bonds
Trust bonds are mechanisms that align incentives between data providers and consumers. They create economic relationships that promote data quality and reliability.

## Development Terms

### GraphQL API
The primary interface for querying and interacting with Intuition data. Provides a flexible, type-safe way to access atoms, triples, and signals.

### SDKs
Software Development Kits that provide language-specific interfaces for building applications on Intuition. Available for multiple programming languages and frameworks.

### Primitives
The fundamental building blocks that developers use to create applications. These include atoms, triples, signals, and bonding curves.

## Economic Terms

### Data Markets
Decentralized marketplaces where atoms can be bought, sold, and traded. Prices are determined by bonding curves and market dynamics.

### Incentive Mechanisms
Economic structures that encourage participation and contribution to the network. Includes rewards for data provision, validation, and curation.

### Token Economics
The economic model governing the distribution and use of tokens within the Intuition ecosystem.

## Technical Terms

### Smart Contracts
Self-executing contracts that automate interactions and enforce rules within the Intuition ecosystem.

### Blockchain Transactions
Operations that modify the state of the blockchain, including atom creation, trading, and network interactions.

### Digital Assets
Any digital representation of value or information that can be owned, traded, or used within the Intuition ecosystem.
