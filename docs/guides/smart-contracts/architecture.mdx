# Smart Contract Architecture

This document provides an overview of the Intuition smart contract architecture, explaining the core components and their interactions.

## Overview

The Intuition protocol is built on a modular architecture of smart contracts that work together to provide a comprehensive decentralized system. Each contract has a specific responsibility and interacts with others through well-defined interfaces.

## Core Components

### Atom Warden

The Atom Warden contract manages the creation, validation, and storage of atomic data units (atoms) in the system. It ensures data integrity and provides a foundation for the protocol's data model.

### Attestor

The Attestor contract handles the verification and attestation of data, allowing trusted entities to validate information and provide cryptographic proof of its authenticity.

### Bonding Curve Registry

This contract manages the various bonding curves used for token pricing and market dynamics, enabling flexible economic models for different use cases.

### Trust Bonding

The Trust Bonding contract implements reputation and trust mechanisms, allowing users to build and maintain their standing within the system.

### Multi-Vault Contracts

Both the ETH Multi-Vault and Trust Multi-Vault contracts provide secure storage and management of assets, with different security and access models for different types of assets.

## Contract Interactions

The contracts in the Intuition protocol interact through a series of well-defined interfaces:

1. **Data Flow**: Atoms are created and validated by the Atom Warden, then attested by the Attestor.
2. **Economic Models**: The Bonding Curve Registry defines pricing models that interact with the Multi-Vault contracts for asset management.
3. **Trust Mechanisms**: The Trust Bonding contract provides reputation data that influences permissions and capabilities across the system.

## Security Considerations

The architecture is designed with security as a primary concern:

- **Modularity**: Each contract has a single responsibility, reducing attack surface
- **Upgradability**: Contracts can be upgraded independently while maintaining compatibility
- **Access Control**: Granular permissions system for different operations
- **Auditability**: All operations are transparent and verifiable on-chain

## Future Developments

The architecture is designed to be extensible, allowing for:

- New contract types to be added as needed
- Enhanced functionality through contract upgrades
- Integration with other blockchain protocols and systems
