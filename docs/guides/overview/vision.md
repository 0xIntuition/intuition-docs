# The Vision

Intuition is an ambitious project to build a programmable knowledge infrastructure that makes truth-seeking and coordination easier for both humans and machines. At its core, Intuition is creating the world’s first open, semantic token-curated knowledge graph – a universal data layer where identities, information, and algorithms are decoupled from any single application.

This “trustful interaction layer” is designed to handle everything from objective facts to subjective opinions in a verifiable way, so people and AI can get the information they need, when they need it, from sources they trust. 

In essence, Intuition’s long-term goal is to enhance our collective intuition by making knowledge transparent and machine-verifiable – what the team calls epistemic legibility, where the status of claims and evidence is plainly accessible and auditable by anyone. 

How will this change the game? Intuition aspires to transform how we coordinate, compute, and verify knowledge at scale. By building a programmable platform for truth, it enables new forms of coordination: communities can align on shared facts and make decisions with confidence in the data. Information becomes computationally accessible – structured in a way that algorithms and AI agents can reason over it, perform analyses, or filter content based on provable criteria. 

Crucially, knowledge verification is baked into the infrastructure: every claim comes with provenance and incentive alignment, so trust becomes a first-class property of the web rather than an afterthought. The vision is a future where technologically-mediated intuition augments human decision-making – where misinformation has nowhere to hide, and genuine insight can flourish. As the Intuition team puts it, their mission is to empower people to build, explore, and curate a peer-to-peer knowledge ecosystem that “enhances our collective intuition.
