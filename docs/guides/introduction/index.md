# The Trust Protocol

Intuition is building the world's first open and semantic token-curated knowledge graph, decoupling identities, data, and algorithms from the application layer. This universal and permissionless data lake opens the door to a new pillar of the decentralized web - a **trustful interaction layer**, capable of handling both objective facts and subjective opinions, where people and machines have the data they need, when they need it - forever changing the way the web is interacted with and developed.

Intuition was created to address the limitations of the current identity and data paradigm, where centralized models have resulted in large, inaccessible data silos prone to misuse, raising concerns over privacy and transparency, and requiring developers to focus too much of their attention on these layers of the stack. By embracing decentralized technologies, Intuition offers a new model for managing identities and data, as well as for trust and identity verification, that prioritizes user ownership and empowerment, data integrity, open access, and discoverability.

## Where trustful interaction meets trustless code

At its core, Intuition is building a knowledge and social graph that integrates incentive-driven mechanisms, decentralized identifiers, and semantic data structures to lay the foundation for a trustworthy internet. With the introduction of a few novel primitives, Intuition unlocks the ability to operationalize information and trust at an unprecedented scale.

The system provides applications and their users easy access to a semantically rich dataset about everything and anything, where both objective facts *and* subjective opinions can coexist and be validated, fostering informed decision-making and enhancing the security of digital interactions.

We believe in a future of data and knowledge where **information** is not just stored but made **verifiable**, wrapped in a semantic embrace, mapped by a directed graph of state changes captured on an immutable ledger. The Intuition System is the world's first open and semantic knowledge graph, decoupling identities, data, and algorithms from the application layer.

## Problems with Current Information Systems

Intuition offers a new model for trust and identity to address the limitations of the current paradigm, specifically:

### **Lack of Verification & Provenance**

- Difficulty in confirming data authenticity and source credibility.
- No standard for tracing content back to its origin.

### **Inherent Bias & Inequality**

- AI and data models often inherit biases from their sources.
- Skewed insights lead to mistrust in outcomes and decisions.

### **Poor Accountability Mechanisms**

- Weak accountability for contributors spreading false or misleading information.
- Lack of transparency and incentives for accuracy.

### **Privacy & Data Security Gaps**

- User data often collected without full transparency or consent
- Concerns over data breaches and surveillance compromise trust.

### **Incentives Misaligned with Quality**

- Platforms prioritize engagement (clicks, views) over information accuracy.
- Sensationalism is rewarded more than credibility.

### **Fragmentation & Lack of Interoperability**

- Information platforms operate in silos, hindering cross-verification.
- Absence of unified standards weakens the consistency of trust signals.

Intuition seeks to leverage game theoretic cryptoeconomics to solve these problems at scale to foster a truly interoperable web - one more akin to the Tim Berners-Lee's vision for the Semantic Web.

**A Semantic Web of Trust.**
