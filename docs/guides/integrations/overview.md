# Integrations

Intuition integrates with various platforms and tools to extend its capabilities beyond the core knowledge graph protocol.

## AI Integration

Use Intuition's knowledge graph with AI systems and agents to create persistent, verifiable memory and context.

- **[AI Overview](/docs/integrations/ai/overview)** - AI capabilities and use cases
- **[MCP Server](/docs/integrations/ai/mcp-server)** - Model Context Protocol integration

**Use cases:**
- **AI agents with persistent memory** - Store and retrieve agent knowledge on-chain
- **LLM context enhancement** - Provide verified context to language models
- **Knowledge graph reasoning** - Enable semantic reasoning over structured data
- **Semantic search for AI** - Query knowledge graphs for relevant information

## Coming Soon

We're working on integrations with leading platforms across multiple categories:

### Social Platforms

Build social experiences with verifiable attestations:

- **Farcaster Frames** - Embed Intuition attestations in Farcaster
- **Lens Protocol** - Integrate with decentralized social graphs
- **Twitter/X** - Share and verify claims on traditional social media

### Identity & Naming

Connect identity systems to atoms:

- **ENS Integration** - Link ENS names to Intuition atoms
- **DID Standards** - Decentralized identifier support (W3C)
- **Sismo Connect** - Privacy-preserving credential verification

### Storage & Data

Extend atom data with decentralized storage:

- **IPFS/Filecoin** - Store atom metadata and large files
- **Arweave** - Permanent storage for important attestations
- **Ceramic Network** - Composable data streams

### DeFi & Governance

Bring attestations to DeFi and DAOs:

- **Snapshot** - On-chain voting with attestation-based eligibility
- **Tally** - DAO governance integration
- **Safe (Gnosis)** - Multi-sig attestations and approvals

### Developer Tools

Enhanced developer experience:

- **Hardhat Plugin** - Deploy and test Intuition contracts
- **Foundry Integration** - Testing framework support
- **Ethers.js Plugin** - Simplified SDK integration

### Oracles & Data

Connect off-chain data to the knowledge graph:

- **Chainlink** - Oracle integration for external data
- **The Graph** - Subgraph integration
- **API3** - First-party oracle data

## Request an Integration

Have an integration idea? We'd love to hear from you!

**Ways to get involved:**
- **[Community Forum](https://atlas.discourse.group)** - Propose and discuss integrations
- **[Discord](https://discord.gg/intuition)** - Chat with the team and community

## Building Your Own Integration

Intuition's open architecture makes it easy to build custom integrations:

1. **[SDK Documentation](/docs/developer-tools/sdk/getting-started/installation)** - Start with the TypeScript SDK
2. **[Protocol API](/docs/developer-tools/protocol/api-reference/multivault/atoms)** - Direct smart contract integration
3. **[GraphQL API](/docs/developer-tools/graphql-api/getting-started/quickstart)** - Query the knowledge graph

## Examples

See these integration patterns:

- **[Atoms Guide](/docs/developer-tools/sdk/atoms-guide)** - Working with atoms
- **[Triples Guide](/docs/developer-tools/sdk/triples-guide)** - Creating attestations
- **[Vaults Guide](/docs/developer-tools/sdk/vaults-guide)** - Vault operations
