Frequently Asked Questions about Intuition

## General Questions

### What is Intuition?

Intuition is a decentralized protocol that enables the creation of trustful interactions through atomic primitives. It provides a foundation for building decentralized applications that can establish and maintain trust between parties.

### How does Intuition work?

Intuition uses atomic primitives (atoms, triples, signals, and bonding curves) to create trustful interactions. These primitives can be combined to build complex decentralized applications that maintain trust without requiring centralized intermediaries.

### What are the main components of Intuition?

- **Atoms**: The basic units of trust and reputation
- **Triples**: Relationships between atoms that encode trust
- **Signals**: Mechanisms for updating trust relationships
- **Bonding Curves**: Economic models for token pricing and liquidity

## Technical Questions

### How do I get started with Intuition?

1. **Read the Documentation**: Start with the Overview and Quick Start guides
2. **Set up Development Environment**: Install the necessary SDKs and tools
3. **Build Your First App**: Follow the tutorials to create a simple application
4. **Join the Community**: Connect with other developers and get support

### What programming languages are supported?

Intuition supports multiple programming languages through various SDKs:
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Official SDK with full feature support
- **Python**: Python SDK for backend development
- **Rust**: Low-level SDK for performance-critical applications
- **Go**: Go SDK for server-side applications

### How do I deploy an application on Intuition?

1. **Develop Your App**: Build your application using Intuition primitives
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Test on testnet before mainnet deployment
3. **Deploy Contracts**: Deploy your smart contracts to the network
4. **Launch Application**: Make your application available to users

## Economic Questions

### How does the token economics work?

Intuition uses a dual-token system:
- **INTUITION**: The main network token used for staking and governance
- **Application Tokens**: Tokens specific to individual applications

### How can I earn rewards?

- **Staking**: Stake INTUITION tokens to earn rewards
- **Running Nodes**: Operate network nodes to earn block rewards
- **Building Applications**: Create successful applications that generate fees
- **Contributing**: Participate in governance and development

### What are bonding curves?

Bonding curves are mathematical functions that determine token pricing based on supply and demand. They provide automated market making and liquidity for application tokens.

## Development Questions

### How do I integrate Intuition into my existing app?

1. **Install SDK**: Add the appropriate Intuition SDK to your project
2. **Configure Connection**: Set up connection to the Intuition network
3. **Implement Primitives**: Use atoms, triples, signals, and bonding curves
4. **Test Integration**: Thoroughly test your integration before production

### What are the best practices for building on Intuition?

- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic primitives before building complex systems
- **Test Extensively**: Use testnets for all development and testing
- **Follow Security Guidelines**: Implement proper security measures
- **Document Your Code**: Maintain clear documentation for your applications

### How do I handle errors and edge cases?

- **Implement Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error handling to your applications
- **Use Fallback Mechanisms**: Implement fallbacks for critical operations
- **Monitor Applications**: Set up monitoring and alerting for your applications
- **Plan for Upgrades**: Design your applications to be upgradeable
