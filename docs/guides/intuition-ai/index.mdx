# Intuition AI

Intuition AI enables powerful integrations between AI models and the Intuition knowledge graph, allowing AI systems to query, create, and interact with decentralized trust data.

## What is Intuition AI?

Intuition AI bridges the gap between artificial intelligence and decentralized knowledge systems, enabling:

- **Semantic Queries**: AI models can query the knowledge graph using natural language
- **Knowledge Creation**: Programmatically create Atoms and Triples through AI analysis
- **Trust Analysis**: Leverage AI for intelligent signal attestation and pattern recognition
- **Context Enhancement**: Enrich AI responses with verified on-chain data

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

The cornerstone of Intuition AI is our MCP server, which provides a standardized way for AI models to interact with the Intuition protocol through the Model Context Protocol specification.

### Key Capabilities

- **Extract Triples**: Convert natural language into structured knowledge triples
- **Search Entities**: Find atoms, accounts, and concepts across the knowledge graph
- **Account Information**: Retrieve detailed information about accounts and their connections
- **Social Graphs**: Explore following/follower relationships and recommendations
- **List Management**: Search and manage curated lists of entities

## Use Cases

### Knowledge Graph Queries
AI models can ask questions like "What are the most trusted DeFi protocols?" and receive structured data from the knowledge graph.

### Automated Knowledge Creation
Transform unstructured data and natural language into structured Atoms and Triples automatically.

### Trust Signal Analysis
Use AI to analyze patterns in trust signals and provide insights about entity reliability.

### Enhanced AI Context
Enrich AI model responses with verified, on-chain data about entities and relationships.

## Open Source

All Intuition AI components are open source and available on GitHub. The MCP server is actively maintained and welcomes community contributions.
