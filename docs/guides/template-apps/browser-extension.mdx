# Browser Extension Template

This guide will help you get started with building a browser extension using Intuition. The template provides a foundation for creating extensions that work across Chrome, Firefox, and other modern browsers.

## Features

- Cross-browser compatibility
- Intuition SDK integration
- React-based popup and options pages
- Content scripts
- Background service worker
- TypeScript support
- State management with Zustand
- Testing setup
- Build system with Vite
- Hot reload during development

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- Node.js 18 or later installed
- npm or yarn package manager
- Basic knowledge of browser extensions
- An Intuition account and API key

## Getting Started

1. Create a new project using the template:

```bash
npx create-intuition-app my-extension --template browser-extension
cd my-extension
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up your environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your Intuition API key and other configuration values.

4. Start the development build:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Load the extension in your browser:
   - Chrome: Open chrome://extensions/, enable Developer mode, click "Load unpacked", select the `dist` folder
   - Firefox: Open about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox, click "Load Temporary Add-on", select the `manifest.json` in the `dist` folder
