# Bonding Curves

Bonding curves are mathematical functions that determine the price of tokens or assets based on their current supply. They are a core economic mechanism in the Intuition system, enabling dynamic pricing and automated market making.

## What are Bonding Curves?

Bonding curves are price functions that:

- **Automatically Price Assets**: Price is determined by the current supply
- **Enable Continuous Trading**: Allow for continuous buying and selling
- **Provide Liquidity**: Create automatic market making capabilities
- **Align Incentives**: Create economic incentives for early adopters

## Bonding Curve Types

### Linear Curves
Simple linear relationships between price and supply:
```
Price = Base Price + (Supply × Slope)
```

### Exponential Curves
Curves that grow exponentially with supply:
```
Price = Base Price × (1 + Growth Rate)^Supply
```

### Polynomial Curves
More complex curves with multiple terms:
```
Price = a + b×Supply + c×Supply² + d×Supply³
```

## Creating Bonding Curves

### Curve Parameters
Define the key parameters for your bonding curve:

```javascript
const curveParams = {
  basePrice: 0.01,
  slope: 0.001,
  maxSupply: 1000000,
  curveType: "linear"
}
```

### Curve Validation
Ensure your curve parameters are valid:
- Positive base price
- Appropriate slope for your use case
- Reasonable maximum supply
- Sustainable economic model

## Using Bonding Curves

### Buying Tokens
When someone buys tokens, the price increases according to the curve.

### Selling Tokens
When someone sells tokens, the price decreases according to the curve.

### Price Discovery
The curve automatically discovers the fair market price based on supply and demand.

### Liquidity Provision
Bonding curves provide automatic liquidity for trading.

## Economic Implications

### Early Adopter Benefits
Early buyers benefit from lower prices as supply increases.

### Sunk Cost Effect
The curve creates incentives to hold rather than sell immediately.

### Market Efficiency
Automated pricing reduces manipulation and improves market efficiency.

### Revenue Distribution
Curve parameters determine how revenue is distributed among stakeholders.

## Best Practices

1. **Careful Parameter Selection**: Choose parameters that align with your economic goals
2. **Testing**: Test curves with various scenarios before deployment
3. **Transparency**: Make curve parameters and formulas publicly available
4. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor curve performance and adjust if needed
5. **Education**: Help users understand how the curve affects pricing

## Examples

```javascript
// Linear bonding curve implementation
function calculatePrice(supply, basePrice, slope) {
  return basePrice + (supply * slope);
}

function calculateBuyPrice(currentSupply, amount, basePrice, slope) {
  const currentPrice = calculatePrice(currentSupply, basePrice, slope);
  const newSupply = currentSupply + amount;
  const newPrice = calculatePrice(newSupply, basePrice, slope);
  return (currentPrice + newPrice) / 2 * amount;
}
```
