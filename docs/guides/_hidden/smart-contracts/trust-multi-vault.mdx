# TrustMultiVault

`TrustMultiVault.sol` extends the functionality of EthMultiVault with trust-based delegation and advanced recovery mechanisms.

## Features

- Trust-based delegation system
- Social recovery mechanisms
- Configurable trust scores
- Delegation expiry
- Threshold adjustment based on trust scores
- Inherited multi-signature functionality
- Advanced access control

## Contract Interface

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

interface ITrustMultiVault {
    function delegateTrust(
        address delegate,
        uint256 trustScore,
        uint256 expiryTime
    ) external;
    
    function revokeDelegation(address delegate) external;
    
    function initiateRecovery(address newOwner) external;
    
    function supportRecovery(address newOwner) external;
    
    function executeRecovery(address newOwner) external;
    
    function adjustTrustScore(address delegate, uint256 newScore) external;
}
```

## Trust System

### Trust Delegation
```solidity
function delegateTrust(
    address delegate,
    uint256 trustScore,
    uint256 expiryTime
) external {
    require(trustScore <= MAX_TRUST_SCORE);
    require(expiryTime > block.timestamp);
    
    delegations[delegate] = Delegation({
        score: trustScore,
        expiry: expiryTime,
        active: true
    });
    
    emit TrustDelegated(msg.sender, delegate, trustScore, expiryTime);
}
```

### Trust Score Calculation
```solidity
function calculateEffectiveScore(address delegate) public view returns (uint256) {
    Delegation memory delegation = delegations[delegate];
    if (!delegation.active || delegation.expiry <= block.timestamp) {
        return 0;
    }
    return delegation.score;
}
```

## Recovery System

The recovery system allows trusted delegates to help recover access to the vault in case of key loss:

1. **Initiate Recovery**
```solidity
function initiateRecovery(address newOwner) external {
    require(calculateEffectiveScore(msg.sender) >= RECOVERY_THRESHOLD);
    recoveryProposals[newOwner].initiator = msg.sender;
    recoveryProposals[newOwner].timestamp = block.timestamp;
    emit RecoveryInitiated(msg.sender, newOwner);
}
```

2. **Support Recovery**
```solidity
function supportRecovery(address newOwner) external {
    require(calculateEffectiveScore(msg.sender) >= SUPPORT_THRESHOLD);
    recoveryProposals[newOwner].supporters.push(msg.sender);
    emit RecoverySupported(msg.sender, newOwner);
}
```

3. **Execute Recovery**
```solidity
function executeRecovery(address newOwner) external {
    RecoveryProposal storage proposal = recoveryProposals[newOwner];
    require(block.timestamp >= proposal.timestamp + RECOVERY_DELAY);
    require(calculateTotalSupportScore(newOwner) >= EXECUTION_THRESHOLD);
    
    _transferOwnership(newOwner);
    emit RecoveryExecuted(newOwner);
}
```

## Events

```solidity
event TrustDelegated(address indexed owner, address indexed delegate, uint256 score, uint256 expiry);
event DelegationRevoked(address indexed owner, address indexed delegate);
event RecoveryInitiated(address indexed initiator, address indexed newOwner);
event RecoverySupported(address indexed supporter, address indexed newOwner);
event RecoveryExecuted(address indexed newOwner);
event TrustScoreAdjusted(address indexed delegate, uint256 newScore);
```

## Security Considerations

- Trust scores are capped at MAX_TRUST_SCORE
- Delegations have mandatory expiry times
- Recovery requires multiple trusted delegates
- Time-locked recovery process
- Trust score adjustments are restricted
- Inherited security features from EthMultiVault

## Testing

```typescript
describe("TrustMultiVault", () => {
  it("should delegate trust correctly", async () => {
    const delegate = addr1;
    const trustScore = 50;
    const expiryTime = (await time.latest()) + time.duration.days(30);
    
    await vault.delegateTrust(delegate, trustScore, expiryTime);
    
    const delegation = await vault.delegations(delegate);
    expect(delegation.score).to.equal(trustScore);
    expect(delegation.expiry).to.equal(expiryTime);
    expect(delegation.active).to.be.true;
  });
});
```

## Deployment

### Hardhat
```typescript
const TrustMultiVault = await ethers.getContractFactory("TrustMultiVault");
const vault = await TrustMultiVault.deploy(
  [signer1, signer2, signer3],
  2,
  RECOVERY_THRESHOLD,
  SUPPORT_THRESHOLD,
  EXECUTION_THRESHOLD
);
await vault.deployed();
```

### Foundry
```bash
forge create TrustMultiVault \
  --constructor-args \
  "[0x123..., 0x456..., 0x789...]" 2 70 30 80 \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL \
