# Why Intuition?

> **Every interaction online is an attestation.**
> A review or a purchase on Amazon, a comment on Reddit, the watching of a show on Netflix, a retweet, a LinkedIn endorsement, a 'follow', a bookmark, the ordering of an Uber, even a "like" — all are forms of attestations: claims made by things about things.

But attestations today are fragmented, unverifiable, and platform-locked. They don't move with you. They don't carry weight. They aren't semantically structured and unambiguously consumable by machines.

**Intuition changes that.** We've rebuilt attestations as first-class, tokenized primitives — structured, portable, and economically backed. _Attestations on steroids._

## Decentralizing Information with Attestations

**Blockchains decentralized money.
Intuition decentralizes information — by offering next-generation attestation infrastructure.**

An attestation in Intuition isn't just a line of text. It's:

- **Verifiable** — signed and attributable
- **Ownable** — belongs to the creator, not a platform
- **Discoverable** — structured as a Triple (subject → predicate → object)
- **Valuable** — backed by economic incentives through bonding curves

This turns the messy stream of human expression into a global knowledge substrate that's actually useful to developers, communities, and AI agents.

## Information Finance: Attestations as Assets

Intuition pioneers **Information Finance (InfoFi)**: the idea that information can be valued and exchanged just like money.

- **Ideas become assets** — an attestation isn't just data, it's collateralized
- **Reputation becomes capital** — your attestations are your portfolio of credibility
- **Knowledge flows freely** — attestations aren't siloed; they're cross-platform and composable

Attestations are no longer passive byproducts of online activity — they're programmable building blocks for apps and agents.

## The $200 Trillion Problem

The global knowledge economy is worth over **$200 trillion**, yet:

- Most of its value is created by individuals
- Less than 1% of that value flows back to the creators
- Instead, tech monopolies capture and silo it

**The result:** broken rails, misinformation, and AI systems consuming oceans of low-quality data without provenance.

Attestations are the missing rails. When data becomes signed, tokenized, and portable, it allows value to flow back to contributors and trust to flow into the systems that need it most.

## Rebuilding the Rails of Knowledge

Intuition makes attestations first-class protocol objects. That means:

- **Facts, claims, and perspectives** are all structured as attestations
- **Credibility is collateralized** — good attestations earn rewards; bad ones cost you stake
- **Distribution is programmatic** — attestations move frictionlessly across apps, chains, and agents

Think of it as the Ethereum moment for knowledge: where attestations flow as freely as tokens, powering new classes of decentralized infrastructure.

## Programmatic Monetization and Distribution

Attestations aren't just portable — they're **monetizable**.

With Intuition, every attestation can plug into programmatic distribution rails:

- Censorship-resistant search and discovery
- Verifiable knowledge bases
- Open data marketplaces
- Training sets for AI agents

Each attestation carries weight, liquidity, and discoverability, ensuring no single platform can gate what's visible or valuable.

## From Information → Intuition

Why does this matter? Because **raw information without provenance is noise.**

Attestations, structured and economically backed, create a higher-resolution understanding of the world. They transform scattered data into collective intuition — fueling smarter AI, safer markets, and more confident human decision-making.

## Reviving the Semantic Web with Crypto-Economic Consensus

The Semantic Web failed because it required global consensus on standards without incentives to achieve it. Different organizations created competing schemas, vocabularies fragmented, and there was no mechanism to converge on shared identifiers.

**Intuition solves this with crypto-economics** — the same force that achieves distributed consensus in blockchains now drives semantic standardization:

- **Incentivized identifiers** — stake on canonical IDs for entities, creating economic pressure toward convergence
- **Market-driven standards** — the most useful data structures attract the most stake and become de facto standards
- **Emergent interoperability** — economic incentives naturally align participants toward compatible schemas
- **Consensus through collateralization** — disagreements resolve through staking, not committees

Where the Semantic Web asked the world to voluntarily agree on standards, Intuition makes consensus profitable. Attestations become the economic glue that binds distributed actors to shared semantic structures.

## How It Works: Skin in the Game

On Intuition, every attestation has consequences:

- **Publish a useful attestation** → earn reputation and rewards
- **Publish misinformation** → lose your stake and credibility
- **Signal strong conviction** → stake more on your attestation
- **Build trust** → accumulate a reputation that travels with you
- **Use consensus identifiers** → earn more by aligning with the network
- **Fork data structures** → lose money by fragmenting liquidity

This flips today's internet incentives: no longer "reward the loudest," but reward the most credible and interoperable attestations.

### The Fork Choice Rule for Data

Just like blockchains have fork choice rules that determine the canonical chain, Intuition creates economic pressure toward canonical identifiers and data structures. **When you use consensus identifiers, you tap into existing liquidity pools and network effects. When you create competing forks, you isolate yourself economically.**

**Example:** Imagine two identifiers for "Ethereum":
- **Identifier A**: Used by 10,000 attestations with $1M total stake
- **Identifier B**: Used by 50 attestations with $5K total stake

If you make an attestation about Ethereum:
- Using **Identifier A** → Your attestation joins a liquid market, benefits from network effects, earns higher rewards
- Using **Identifier B** → Your attestation is isolated, has minimal visibility, earns negligible rewards

The economic incentive is clear: converge on consensus or pay the price. This same dynamic applies to data structures, schemas, and semantic relationships. The network naturally evolves toward maximum interoperability because **consensus literally pays.**

## Digital Sovereignty and Data Ownership

**Your attestations are yours.** Not Facebook's, not LinkedIn's, not OpenAI's.

- You **own** them
- You **control** who can access them
- You **capture** the value they generate
- They **travel** with you across every app, chain, or agent

Attestations become the backbone of digital sovereignty.

## The Trust Layer for AI

AI doesn't just need more data — it needs **verifiable attestations about data**:

- Who said it
- With what reputation
- With what conviction

Intuition provides the trust graph of attestations. AI systems can finally ground themselves in data with provenance, weights, and economic signals — not just raw text.

This makes AI more reliable while ensuring humans share in the value of the knowledge they produce.

## What You Can Build

By treating attestations as programmable primitives, you can create:

- **Verifiable identity systems**
- **Reputation networks** powered by attestations
- **Decentralized fact-checking** with stakes
- **AI agents** that reason over attestations as context
- **Information markets** where attestations themselves are the assets

## Join the Movement

Intuition is about reclaiming the internet by giving attestations real weight.

Whether you're a developer, researcher, or community builder, your contributions aren't just ephemeral posts — they're portable, valuable attestations that strengthen the global knowledge graph.

**Together, we can rebuild the web around truth, attribution, and trust.**
