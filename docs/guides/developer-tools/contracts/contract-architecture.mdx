# Contract Architecture

Intuition's smart contracts are central to the user experience, handling critical onchain activities such as the creation of Atoms (also known as Identities) and Triples (also known as Claims), as well as the staking and rewards.

# MultiVault

The MultiVault contract is the core component of Intuition's architecture, responsible for managing the creation of Atoms/Triples and handling deposits, redemptions, and share distributions. It supports multiple bonding curve implementations through a registry system.

- **Creation**: Users can create Atoms and Triples
- **Deposits**: Users can deposit ETH to receive shares in atoms/triples
- **Redemptions**: Users can redeem shares for ETH
- **Multi-Vault**: Supports multiple bonding curve implementations
- **Share Distribution**: Manages the minting and burning of shares
- **Fee Collection**: Collects small fees to maintain the system

# Trust Token
The Trust Token contract is an ERC-20 compliant token that serves as the native utility token within the Intuition ecosystem. It is used for deposits, staking, governance, and accessing various features of the platform. 

- **ERC-20 Compliance**: Fully compliant with the ERC-20 standard
- **Minting and Burning**: Controlled minting and burning of tokens
- **Transfers**: Standard token transfer functionality

:::info
The Trust Token contract is **deployed on Base** and is the **native gas token on the Intuition Network L3 chain**.
:::

# Wrapped Trust
The Wrapped Trust contract is an ERC-20 compliant token that lives on the Intuition Network L3 chain. After users bridge their Trust tokens from Base to the Intuition Network L3 chain, they can receive Wrapped Trust tokens by depositing Trust tokens into the Wrapped Trust contract.

:::tip 
**Wrapped Trust tokens can be used for staking in the Trust Bonding contract.**

# Trust Bonding
The Trust Bonding contract is a smart contract introduced in V2. Inheriting from the Curve VotingEscrow contract, it enables staking of Wrapped Trust to earn rewards and participate in governance. Key features include:

- **Staking**: Users can stake Wrapped Trust to earn rewards
- **Locking**: Users can lock their stake for a specified duration to increase voting power
- **Rewards**: Users earn rewards based on their stake and lock duration
- **Governance**: Stakers can participate in governance decisions

# Bonding Curve Registry
The Bonding Curve Registry contract is a registry for bonding curve implementations. It allows the MultiVault contract to look up and use different bonding curve implementations. Key features include:

- **Registration**: Developers can register new bonding curve implementations
- **Lookup**: The MultiVault contract can look up bonding curve implementations by ID
- **Management**: The registry can be managed by the contract owner

# BaseEmissionsController
The BaseEmissionsController contract is responsible for managing the emissions of Trust tokens. It controls the rate at which new Trust tokens are minted and distributed to stakers in the Trust Bonding contract. Key features include:

- **Emission Rate**: Controls the rate of Trust token emissions
- **Distribution**: Distributes newly minted Trust tokens to the SatelliteEmissionsController
- **Bridging**: Uses the Caldera MetaLayer protocol to bridge emissions to the Intuition Network L3 chain

# SatelliteEmissionsController
The SatelliteEmissionsController contract is responsible for managing the emissions of Trust tokens on the Intuition Network L3 chain. It receives emissions from the BaseEmissionsController and distributes them to stakers via the Trust Bonding contract. Key features include:

- **Receiving Emissions**: Receives Trust token emissions from the BaseEmissionsController
- **Distribution**: Distributes Trust tokens to stakers via the Trust Bonding contract
- **Bridging/Burning**: Uses the Caldera MetaLayer protocol to bridge/burn emissions back to Base
