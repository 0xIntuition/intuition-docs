# Contract Architecture

This section provides a comprehensive overview of Intuition's smart contract architecture, including the core components, design patterns, and how different contracts interact with each other.

## Implementation Overview

  backgroundColor: 'var(--ifm-color-emphasis-100)', 
  border: '1px solid var(--ifm-color-emphasis-300)', 
  borderRadius: '8px', 
  padding: '1.5rem', 
  margin: '2rem 0',

}}>

Intuition's smart contracts are central to its blockchain architecture, handling critical on-chain activities such as the creation of Atoms (also known as Identities) and Triples (also known as Claims), as well as the staking processes on these elements. These contracts are integral to the economic interactions involved in creating and staking, ensuring a seamless and secure execution of these operations.

  border: '1px solid var(--ifm-color-emphasis-200)', 
  borderRadius: '6px', 
  padding: '1rem', 
  margin: '1rem 0'
}}>

Future development will expand how these smart contracts are used to govern various other integral components within the Intuition system, including:

- **Atom Claiming/Recovery**: Mechanisms for claiming and recovering atom ownership
- **Off-chain Atom Data Management**: Systems for managing atom metadata and properties
- **Bonding Curve Registry**: Registry for different bonding curve implementations
- **Primitive Registry**: Registry for different primitive types and implementations
- **Schema Registry**: Registry for data schemas and validation rules
- **Algorithm Registry**: Registry for algorithms and computational primitives
- **Interpretation Registry**: Registry for data interpretation and transformation rules

</div>

### Verifiable Data Registry

<div style={{ 
  backgroundColor: 'var(--ifm-color-emphasis-50)', 
  border: '1px solid var(--ifm-color-emphasis-200)', 
  borderRadius: '6px', 
  padding: '1rem', 
  margin: '1rem 0'
}}>

Acting as the Verifiable Data Registry, these smart contracts store crucial information like URIs of Atoms/Triples, the intricate relationships between them, and current stakeholder positions. They essentially form the nodes and edges of the knowledge graph. In contrast, the off-chain Verifiable Data Registry maintains the properties of these nodes and edges, creating a comprehensive and interconnected data structure.

## System Overview

Intuition's smart contract system is built on a modular architecture that enables trustful interactions and economic incentives. The system consists of several key components:

### Core Components

- **Trust Bonding Contracts**: Handle the creation and management of trust bonds
- **Bonding Curve Contracts**: Manage dynamic pricing mechanisms
- **Multi-Vault Contracts**: Handle asset storage and management
- **Registry Contracts**: Maintain system-wide registries and mappings
- **Governance Contracts**: Handle decentralized governance mechanisms

### Design Principles

1. **Modularity**: Each contract has a specific responsibility and can be upgraded independently
2. **Security**: Extensive security measures and audit processes
3. **Gas Efficiency**: Optimized for cost-effective operations
4. **Upgradability**: Support for contract upgrades while maintaining state
5. **Interoperability**: Contracts can interact seamlessly with each other

## Contract Layers

### Layer 1: Core Contracts
The foundational layer that defines the basic primitives and economic mechanisms.

### Layer 2: Management Contracts
Contracts that manage the lifecycle and interactions of core contracts.

### Layer 3: Integration Contracts
Contracts that provide interfaces for external systems and applications.

## Core Contract Types

### Trust Bonding Contracts

Trust bonding contracts are the foundation of the Intuition system, enabling users to create and manage trust relationships.

**Key Features:**
- Trust bond creation and management
- Bonding curve integration
- Automated pricing mechanisms
- Liquidity provision

**Example Contract:**

```solidity
contract TrustBonding {
    struct Bond {
        address creator;
        address beneficiary;
        uint256 amount;
        uint256 duration;
        bool active;
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => Bond) public bonds;
    uint256 public bondCounter;
    
    function createBond(
        address _beneficiary,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _duration
    ) external returns (uint256) {
        // Bond creation logic
    }
    
    function activateBond(uint256 _bondId) external {
        // Bond activation logic
    }
}
```

### Bonding Curve Contracts

Bonding curve contracts implement the mathematical functions that determine asset pricing based on supply.

**Key Features:**
- Dynamic pricing algorithms
- Automated market making
- Liquidity provision
- Price discovery mechanisms

**Example Contract:**

```solidity
contract BondingCurve {
    uint256 public basePrice;
    uint256 public slope;
    uint256 public supply;
    
    function calculatePrice(uint256 _supply) public view returns (uint256) {
        return basePrice + (_supply * slope);
    }
    
    function buy(uint256 _amount) external payable {
        uint256 currentPrice = calculatePrice(supply);
        uint256 newSupply = supply + _amount;
        uint256 newPrice = calculatePrice(newSupply);
        uint256 cost = (currentPrice + newPrice) / 2 * _amount;
        
        require(msg.value >= cost, "Insufficient payment");
        
        supply = newSupply;
        // Transfer tokens to buyer
    }
}
```

### Multi-Vault Contracts

Multi-vault contracts handle the storage and management of assets across different vaults.

**Key Features:**
- Asset storage and retrieval
- Vault management
- Cross-vault operations
- Security mechanisms

**Example Contract:**

```solidity
contract MultiVault {
    struct Vault {
        address owner;
        uint256 balance;
        bool active;
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => Vault) public vaults;
    uint256 public vaultCounter;
    
    function createVault() external returns (uint256) {
        uint256 vaultId = vaultCounter++;
        vaults[vaultId] = Vault({
            owner: msg.sender,
            balance: 0,
            active: true
        });
        return vaultId;
    }
    
    function deposit(uint256 _vaultId) external payable {
        require(vaults[_vaultId].active, "Vault not active");
        vaults[_vaultId].balance += msg.value;
    }
}
```

## Contract Interactions

### Trust Bond Creation Flow

1. **User Interaction**: User calls the trust bonding contract
2. **Validation**: Contract validates parameters and user permissions
3. **Bonding Curve Integration**: Price is calculated using bonding curve
4. **Multi-Vault Integration**: Assets are stored in appropriate vaults
5. **Event Emission**: Events are emitted for off-chain processing

### Bonding Curve Integration

1. **Price Calculation**: Current price is calculated based on supply
2. **Payment Processing**: User payment is processed
3. **Supply Update**: Supply is updated according to purchase amount
4. **Token Distribution**: Tokens are distributed to the buyer
5. **Liquidity Provision**: Liquidity is automatically provided

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

- **Role-based Access**: Different roles have different permissions
- **Multi-signature Support**: Critical operations require multiple signatures
- **Timelock Mechanisms**: Delayed execution for governance actions
- **Emergency Pause**: Ability to pause contracts in emergencies

### Audit and Testing

- **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive unit and integration tests
- **Security Audits**: Regular third-party security audits
- **Formal Verification**: Mathematical verification of critical functions
- **Bug Bounty Programs**: Incentives for finding security issues

## Upgrade Mechanisms

### Proxy Pattern

Contracts use the proxy pattern to enable upgrades while maintaining state:

```solidity
contract Proxy {
    address public implementation;
    address public admin;
    
    modifier onlyAdmin() {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Not authorized");
        _;
    }
    
    function upgrade(address _newImplementation) external onlyAdmin {
        implementation = _newImplementation;
    }
    
    fallback() external {
        address _impl = implementation;
        assembly {
            calldatacopy(0, 0, calldatasize())
            let result := delegatecall(gas(), _impl, 0, calldatasize(), 0, 0)
            returndatacopy(0, 0, returndatasize())
            switch result
            case 0 { revert(0, returndatasize()) }
            default { return(0, returndatasize()) }
        }
    }
}
```

### Upgrade Process

1. **Development**: New implementation is developed and tested
2. **Audit**: Implementation undergoes security audit
3. **Governance**: Upgrade is proposed and voted on
4. **Deployment**: New implementation is deployed
5. **Upgrade**: Proxy is updated to point to new implementation

## Gas Optimization

### Efficient Storage

- **Packed Structs**: Optimize storage by packing related data
- **Storage Patterns**: Use efficient storage patterns
- **Batch Operations**: Group operations to reduce gas costs

### Computation Optimization

- **Algorithm Efficiency**: Use efficient algorithms
- **Loop Optimization**: Minimize loop iterations
- **External Calls**: Optimize external contract calls

## Best Practices

1. **Modular Design**: Keep contracts focused and modular
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test all edge cases and scenarios
3. **Security First**: Prioritize security over optimization
4. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation
5. **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring and alerting systems
