# Monorepo Architecture

This guide provides a detailed overview of the architectural design of the Intuition monorepo, explaining how different components interact with each other.

## Package Organization

The Intuition monorepo uses a structured approach to organize packages:

### Core Packages

Core packages provide fundamental functionality used throughout the system:

- **`@intuition/core`** - Core data structures and utilities
- **`@intuition/api`** - GraphQL API definitions and implementations
- **`@intuition/types`** - Shared TypeScript type definitions

### SDK Packages

SDK packages provide language-specific interfaces to the Intuition platform:

- **`@intuition/js-sdk`** - JavaScript/TypeScript SDK
- **`@intuition/react`** - React-specific bindings and hooks

### App Packages

Application packages implement specific user-facing products:

- **Web Applications** - Frontend applications built with Next.js or Remix
- **Mobile Applications** - Mobile apps built with React Native/Expo
- **Developer Tools** - Tools for developers building on Intuition

## Build System

The monorepo uses a sophisticated build system to manage dependencies and ensure packages are built in the correct order:

1. **Dependency Graph Analysis** - Automatically determines build order
2. **Incremental Builds** - Only rebuilds affected packages when changes occur
3. **Parallel Execution** - Builds independent packages simultaneously

## Continuous Integration

The CI/CD pipeline for the monorepo includes:

- **Automated Testing** - Unit and integration tests run for all affected packages
- **Documentation Generation** - Automatic documentation updates
- **Deployment Workflows** - Automated deployment of applications and services

## Development Guidelines

When working in the monorepo:

1. Make targeted changes to specific packages when possible
2. Run tests for affected packages to ensure changes don't break dependencies
3. Follow the established code style and architecture patterns
