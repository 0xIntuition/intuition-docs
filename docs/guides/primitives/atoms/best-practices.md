# Best Practices

## Creating Effective Atoms

1. **Leverage Deterministic IDs**: Remember that identical atomData will always produce the same Atom ID
2. **Check for Similar Atoms**: Search for canonical Atoms before creating variations
3. **Use Clear Data**: Choose descriptive, unambiguous data values
4. **Maintain Single Purpose**: Each Atom should represent one thing
5. **Consider Reusability**: Design Atoms others will want to reference

## Atom Design Patterns

Think of Atoms as **words in the Intuition dictionary**:
- They are the lego-like pieces that snap into many contexts
- Community Signal concentrates on the words that matter most
- Triples form the "sentences" that connect these dictionary words together

## Integration with Triples

Atoms gain their true power when connected via Triples:
- **Subject Atoms**: The entity being described
- **Predicate Atoms**: The relationship or property
- **Object Atoms**: The value or target of the relationship

This separation allows each component to be independently verified, updated, and trusted.
