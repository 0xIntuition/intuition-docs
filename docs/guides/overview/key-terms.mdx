## Core Primitives {#core-primitives}

### **Atoms**

**Atoms** are the fundamental building blocks of the Intuition knowledge graph. Each atom represents a unique entity or concept and points to arbitrary data via a URI.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Universal Identifiers**: Each atom has a unique identifier across the entire system
- **URI References**: Atoms point to any arbitrary URI (web pages, IPFS hashes, etc.)
- **Economic Units**: Atoms can have economic value through bonding curves
- **Composable**: Atoms can be combined to create more complex structures

**Examples:**
- A person's profile (points to their social media or personal website)
- A smart contract address (points to the contract's metadata)
- A piece of content (points to the actual content file)
- An organization (points to their official website)

### **Triples**

**Triples** represent relationships between atoms, forming the edges of the knowledge graph. Each triple consists of three atoms: a subject, predicate, and object.

**Structure:**
```
Subject → Predicate → Object
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Semantic Relationships**: Express meaningful connections between entities
- **Economic Value**: Triples can have economic value through bonding curves
- **Verifiable**: All relationships are cryptographically verifiable
- **Composable**: Triples can be combined to create complex knowledge structures

**Examples:**
- **Subject**: Alice (atom)
- **Predicate**: "works for" (atom)
- **Object**: Intuition Systems (atom)

This creates the statement: "Alice works for Intuition Systems"

### **Signals**

**Signals** represent user attestations or endorsements of atoms and triples. They indicate the strength of belief or support for a particular piece of information.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Economic Weight**: Signals have economic value and can be traded
- **Subjective**: Represent personal beliefs and opinions
- **Aggregatable**: Multiple signals can be combined to show collective sentiment
- **Time-Bound**: Signals can change over time as opinions evolve

**Types of Signals:**
- **Positive Signals**: Endorsements or agreements
- **Negative Signals**: Disagreements or refutations
- **Neutral Signals**: Acknowledgment without taking a position

## Economic Components {#economic-components}

### **Bonding Curves**

**Bonding curves** are mathematical functions that determine the price of shares in atoms and triples based on supply and demand. They create economic incentives for information quality.

**Key Functions:**
- **Price Discovery**: Automatically determine fair market value
- **Incentive Alignment**: Reward early adopters of valuable information
- **Liquidity**: Provide continuous trading opportunities
- **Anti-Speculation**: Prevent manipulation through mathematical constraints

**Curve Types:**
- **Pro-Rata Curves**: Linear pricing for stable assets
- **Bonding Curves**: Dynamic pricing that rewards early adopters
- **Custom Curves**: Specialized functions for specific use cases

### **Vaults**

**Vaults** are smart contracts that hold the economic value associated with atoms and triples. They manage deposits, redemptions, and share distribution.

**Key Functions:**
- **Asset Management**: Safely store and manage user deposits
- **Share Distribution**: Mint and burn shares based on economic activity
- **Fee Collection**: Collect small fees to maintain the system
- **Liquidity Provision**: Enable users to enter and exit positions

**Vault Types:**
- **Pro-Rata Vaults**: Traditional vaults with stable pricing
- **Bonding Curve Vaults**: Dynamic vaults with variable pricing
- **Multi-Curve Vaults**: Vaults supporting multiple pricing models

### **Terms**

**Terms** are the conceptual representations of atoms and triples that contain multiple vaults. They represent the underlying semantic meaning regardless of economic implementation.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Semantic Identity**: Maintains the core meaning across different vaults
- **Economic Flexibility**: Can have multiple vaults with different curves
- **Market Cap Aggregation**: Combines value across all associated vaults
- **Universal Reference**: Provides a stable identifier for the concept

## Network Components {#network-components}

### **Trust Protocol**

The **Trust Protocol** is the foundational mechanism that enables trustful interactions through cryptoeconomic incentives. It rewards users for contributing valuable information.

**Core Principles:**
- **Economic Incentives**: Users are rewarded for valuable contributions
- **Quality Signals**: Economic activity indicates information quality
- **Decentralized Curation**: No central authority controls information
- **Transparent Rules**: All mechanisms are open and verifiable

### **Knowledge Graph**

The **Knowledge Graph** is the collective network of atoms, triples, and signals that represents humanity's shared knowledge. It grows organically through user contributions.

**Key Features:**
- **Permissionless**: Anyone can contribute information
- **Verifiable**: All contributions are cryptographically verifiable
- **Composable**: Information can be combined and reused
- **Economic**: Valuable information is economically rewarded

### **Attestations**

**Attestations** are user statements about atoms and triples that contribute to the collective knowledge. They can be positive, negative, or neutral.

**Types of Attestations:**
- **Factual Claims**: Statements about objective reality
- **Opinions**: Subjective beliefs and preferences
- **Endorsements**: Support for existing information
- **Refutations**: Disagreements with existing information

## Technical Components {#technical-components}
