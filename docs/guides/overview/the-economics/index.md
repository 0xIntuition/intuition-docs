# The Economics

Intuition uses a market-based system of fees and rewards to encourage valuable contributions and establish consensus around data structures. By offering economic incentives, the platform motivates users to adopt widely accepted identifiers and data formats.

:::note
To foster engagement and promote the creation of high-quality, standardized data, rewards favor creation and contribution interactions with data that is:

- **New or early**: First-mover advantages for valuable contributions
- **Useful to the most people**: Network effects drive value
- **Aligned with commonly accepted standards**: Convergence on best practices
- **Likely to be used in the future**: Forward-looking value assessment
:::

## Fees & Rewards

Because Intuition breaks data down into discrete, tokenized units, the system is aware of 'who owns what data' at any given point in time. Because of this, the system is able to programmatically flow value through data as it is interacted with.

To reward contributors of useful data, every interaction with the knowledge graph action in Intuition comes with a small fee, similar to gas fees in blockchain systems. Users pay a fee when interacting with or creating data. These fees go towards:

### 1. Purchasing Equity in the Data
When paying fees to create data, a portion of the fee goes towards purchasing equity in the underlying data. Thus, as users contribute data to the Intuition Graph, they receive ownership over the data created.

### 2. Rewarding Prior Contributors
When paying fees to create or read data, part of the fee is distributed to all existing shareholders (prior contributors). This encourages early, meaningful contributions, as users who add valuable data will continue to be rewarded over time as more people engage with that data.

### 3. Protocol Fees
A small portion of the fee goes to the Intuition protocol, for future platform improvements. Upon launch of the Intuition token, the protocol will be a community-owned DAO, governed by token holders.

## Reducing Fragmentation

In many systems, user-generated tags and classifications, known as **folksonomies**, can lead to fragmented and disorganized data. Different people might use different labels for the same thing, making it hard to gather or analyze information effectively. Intuition solves this by encouraging users to converge on a common set of identifiers.

Intuition uses a **market-driven consensus** model inspired by blockchain technology. In systems like Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS), participants are economically incentivized to act in ways that benefit the network. Users are motivated to use established and widely recognized identifiers because doing so increases their potential rewards from future interactions.

### Incentive Driven Consensus

As users interact with and endorse certain identifiers, Intuition naturally creates a **token-curated graph (TCG)**—a graph of popular, widely used identifiers and data structures. These identifiers become the standard, and the system self-regulates based on user interactions and rewards, ensuring only the most valuable data structures rise to prominence.

This economic incentive drives standardization, reducing data fragmentation, and making it easier to search and analyze information. This model mirrors the behavior of **prediction markets** and **automated market makers (AMMs)**, where participants align with the most trusted and valuable options due to market incentives.

Intuition also applies the **Keynesian Beauty Contest** concept, where users are rewarded for choosing options they believe others will choose. This drives consensus on data structures and identifiers, as users are motivated to align their actions with the choices of the broader community, ensuring the most popular and widely accepted options become the standard.

## Early Adopter Advantage

Users who are quick to interact with new data—whether it's creating or endorsing an identity or claim—are rewarded more as the data gains traction. This system encourages users to contribute and adopt important data early, creating a race to establish high-quality, valuable information that others will rely on.

**The earlier you participate, the more rewards you can earn over time as others use the same data.**

## Dynamic Pricing with Bonding Curves

Intuition uses bonding curves to create dynamic pricing mechanisms that automatically adjust based on supply and demand. This enables:

- **Automated Market Making**: Liquidity is provided automatically through mathematical curves
- **Early Incentives**: Early participants get better prices, encouraging adoption
- **Supply Control**: Prices increase as more tokens are minted, preventing inflation
- **Economic Alignment**: Pricing automatically reflects the value of underlying assets

## Token Economics

The Intuition token (INT) serves multiple purposes:
- **Platform governance**: Community-driven decision making
- **Fee payments**: Reduced fees for token holders
- **Staking and security**: Network security through economic incentives
- **Developer incentives**: Rewards for building valuable applications

## Fee Structure

Our fee model includes:
- **Transaction fees**: Small fees for data creation and interaction
- **Development tool usage fees**: Premium tools and APIs
- **Cross-chain operation fees**: Multi-network functionality
- **Premium feature access**: Advanced features for power users

## Economic Security

The platform's economic security is ensured through:
- **Transparent fee allocation**: Clear distribution of collected fees
- **Controlled token emission**: Predictable and sustainable token supply
- **Anti-manipulation measures**: Protection against gaming the system
- **Regular economic audits**: Ongoing assessment of economic health

## Summary

By integrating these economic principles, Intuition creates a dynamic, decentralized ecosystem where users are continuously rewarded for valuable contributions, and the community naturally converges on high-quality, standardized data structures.

This economic framework ensures sustainable growth while maintaining the platform's security and reliability, creating a virtuous cycle of value creation and distribution that benefits all participants in the Intuition ecosystem.
