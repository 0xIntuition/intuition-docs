**Intuition is a decentralized protocol for building the world's first open, semantic, and token-curated knowledge graph.** It provides the infrastructure for verifiable attestations, portable identity, and trustful interactions at scale—creating a universal data layer that enables information to flow freely across applications, blockchains, and AI agents.

## What is Intuition?
While blockchains have historically decentralized money, **Intuition decentralizes information**—specifically its trust, ownership, discoverability, and monetization. By transforming unstructured, siloed data into structured, verifiable, and economically-backed attestations, Intuition creates a Semantic Web of Trust that makes knowledge programmable and interoperable.


### Core Capabilities

- **Universal Identity**: Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) for people, concepts, organizations, and AI agents with portable, self-sovereign identity management
- **Verifiable Attestations**: Structured claims (subject-predicate-object triples) that are signed, attributable, and economically staked
- **Knowledge Graph**: A semantic layer where facts and opinions coexist with verifiable provenance and economic signals
- **Economic Incentives**: Bonding curves and cryptoeconomic mechanisms that align participants toward canonical standards and high-quality data
## The Architecture
Intuition consists of four foundational layers:

### 1. Intuition Network

A custom Layer 3 blockchain settling to Base, built on Arbitrum Orbit with AnyTrust DA for scalability and cost-efficiency—approximately 10,000x cheaper and 100x faster than traditional alternatives.

### 2. Intuition Protocol

The rules and primitives for representing, incentivizing, and monetizing knowledge through:
- **Atoms**: Unique identifiers for any entity or concept
- **Triples**: Structured attestations linking atoms in subject-predicate-object relationships
- **Signals**: Economic stakes that weight attestations with conviction and accountability

### 3. Rust Subnet

A high-performance indexing and query layer providing real-time APIs and GraphQL endpoints for querying the knowledge graph at scale.

### 4. SDK

The developer interface providing TypeScript SDKs, client libraries, and comprehensive developer tools that enable seamless integration with the Intuition stack. The SDK abstracts the complexity of working with the underlying layers, offering type-safe methods for creating atoms, triples, and signals, as well as querying the knowledge graph.

## Why Intuition Matters

Current information systems suffer from fragmentation, lack of provenance, misaligned incentives, and centralized control. Intuition addresses these challenges by:
- **Making attestations portable**: Your data, identity, and reputation travel with you across platforms
- **Establishing provenance**: Every claim is signed, timestamped, and attributable to its source
- **Aligning incentives**: Economic mechanisms reward accuracy and discourage misinformation
- **Enabling interoperability**: Shared identifiers and standards create a composable knowledge ecosystem
- **Empowering creators**: Data contributors own and monetize their attestations rather than enriching platforms

## Use Cases

Intuition enables a wide range of applications:
- **Decentralized identity and reputation systems**
- **Verifiable credentials and attestations**
- **AI agents with trusted context and memory**
- **Collaborative knowledge curation and fact-checking**
- **Information markets and data monetization**
- **Cross-platform social graphs and preferences**

## Getting Started

Whether you're building applications, contributing data, or exploring the knowledge graph, Intuition provides the tools and infrastructure you need:
- **Developers**: Use our SDKs, APIs, and smart contracts to integrate attestations into your applications
- **Contributors**: Create and stake attestations to build reputation and earn rewards
- **Applications**: Leverage the knowledge graph for trusted context, identity, and data
- **AI Systems**: Access verifiable, semantically-structured training data with provenance
